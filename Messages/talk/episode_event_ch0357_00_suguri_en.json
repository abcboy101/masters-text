    "episode_event_ch0357_00_suguri/4003_1001_2500_10": "Which is why we’re here in search of Pasio\nAcademy students who can help!",

    "episode_event_ch0357_00_suguri/4004_1001_1300_10": "If I remember correctly, that makes a\nPokémon crystallize and change type, right?",

    "episode_event_ch0357_00_suguri/4004_1001_1500_10": "I wanna do it too, but the technique is a\nlittle different from what I’m used to with\nregular Terastallizing...",
