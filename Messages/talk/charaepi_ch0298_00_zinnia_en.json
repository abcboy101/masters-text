    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0200_10": "Ah! Hello, hello, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0300_10": "Pasio is such a lovely place, isn’t it?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0400_10": "There aren’t any wild Pokémon, but everyone\nbrings such a variety along with them.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0500_10": "That’s why you can meet so many different kinds\njust by walking around town.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0600_10": "For example, that Pikachu with you...",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0700_10": "Pikachu has a wide habitation area, so you can\nsee them in a lot of different regions.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0800_10": "But even if they might look like the same, if you\ncheck veeery carefully, you’ll find that they have\ndifferences based on region.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_0900_10": "Maybe your Pikachu could also be—",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1000_10": "Oops, sorry! Ex-researcher habits die hard,\nI suppose.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1100_10": "You might already know this, but I’m currently a\nbiology teacher in the Paldea region.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1200_10": "I love talking about Pokémon, and I wanted to\nencourage more people to like them too.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1300_10": "So maybe I was meant to be a teacher.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0301_1400_10": "I’d like to hear more!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0401_1500_10": "Sure, I can happily go on!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0302_1600_10": "What sorts of things do you teach?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0402_1700_10": "Oh, are you interested?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1800_10": "Well then, let’s have a special lesson about\nFarigiraf.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_1900_10": "Girafarig, the Pokémon which evolves into\nFarigiraf, has a brain in its head and another in\nits tail.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2000_10": "That said, the brain in the tail is small, so it’s\nonly in charge of simple things like spatial\nawareness.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2100_10": "But when Girafarig evolves, its two sets of brain\nwaves sync up, and its psychic power grows\n10 times stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2200_10": "Mysterious happenings like this are what make\nPokémon so fascinating!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2300_10": "I think this gives us an important way to think\nabout us people, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2400_10": "For example, think of when you face a difficult\nproblem.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2500_10": "Do you split up responsibilities among your friends\nand try to find a solution separately like Girafarig?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2600_10": "Or do you work with them and face the problem\ntogether like Farigiraf?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2700_10": "Let’s say those are the two options for solving the\nproblem.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_2800_10": "Which would you choose,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0301_2900_10": "Girafarig’s way",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0401_3000_10": "I see. People do have different strengths and\nweaknesses, so that may be the more effective\napproach.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0302_3100_10": "Farigiraf’s way",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_0402_3200_10": "I see. We might be weak as individuals, but by\nworking together with others, we can be stronger.",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_3300_10": "I respect your choice of method,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_3400_10": "But don’t forget—both approaches depend on you\nhaving friends that you can count on!",
    "charaepi_ch0298_00_zinnia/2301_1201_3500_10": "So make sure you keep on taking care of them!"
