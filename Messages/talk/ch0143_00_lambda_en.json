    "ch0143_00_lambda/7101_0701_01_10": "One of the members of the International Police is\na master of disguise, right?",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7101_0701_02_10": "A battle of disguises between the forces of good\nand evil... If it happens, I’ll have to go all out!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7102_0701_01_10": "What’s the secret to a good disguise? For starters,\nyou gotta observe your target and take note of\ntheir habits!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7102_0701_02_10": "I’ve been watching you carefully, so if I wanted\nto, I could disguise myself as you perfectly!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7102_0701_03_10": "*sigh* If only I could copy your skill at\nPokémon battling...",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7103_0701_01_10": "Pretending to be someone else is actually\npretty fun!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7103_0701_02_10": "And there’s nothing quite like the feeling when\nsomeone falls for it hook, line, and sinker!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/7104_0701_01_10": "There’s a certain Pokémon that always disguises\nitself as a tree.",

    "ch0143_00_lambda/7105_0701_02_10": "No, huh? Well, you’re no fun. And to think, I was\ngonna take real good care of you as your boss!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/1701_0701_01_10": "This is for you! Take it with gratitude!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/1701_0701_02_10": "I am a nice guy! But you owe me one, OK?",

    "ch0143_00_lambda/2501_0702_02_10": "but I have to admit that when I’m watching\nsomeone that unpredictable, there’s never a\ndull moment!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/2511_0701_01_10": "I can disguise myself as Giovanni perfectly. It’s\nhis voice that I can’t quite get down...",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/2511_0701_02_10": "I want to give orders to my partner Pokémon, but\nwithout using words.",

    "ch0143_00_lambda/2511_0701_04_10": "C’mon! You’ve gotta teach me your ways!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/2511_0702_01_10": "Huh? “The power of bonds”? “Just because”?\n“Before I realized it, I was doing it”?!",

    "ch0143_00_lambda/3001_0701_01_10": "You sure are energetic this morning, huh, kid?\nI bet Giovanni would like that about you!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/3003_0701_01_10": "I always disguise myself as someone else when I\neat lunch. Everyone eats in their own unique way,\nso it’s good practice!",
    "ch0143_00_lambda/3005_0701_01_10": "Team Rocket’s real work starts when the sun goes\ndown. Kids like you should hurry up and go to\nbed, though!"
