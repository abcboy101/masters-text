    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4004_1001_2800_10": "We saw Koraidon in the sky, so we followed it!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4004_1001_2900_10": "We thought maybe it meant you were here on\nPasio, Juliana!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4004_1001_3000_10": "Long time no see, Juliana! Now let’s get into it.",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4004_1001_4400_10": "Oh, OK. I think I get it.",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4004_1001_5000_10": "a parallel universe!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0100_10": "A parallel...what?",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0200_10": "A parallel universe! Multiple worlds coexisting!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0300_10": "Which means...this place is neither the future\nnor the past!",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0700_10": "I vibe with his energy, though.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0800_10": "Umm, let me start over.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_0900_10": "I’m Florian—a student from Uva Academy!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1000_10": "This is just a theory, but I think Uva Academy\nand Naranja Academy are one and the same.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1100_10": "Something seems off.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1200_10": "Are they not all from the same school?",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1300_10": "They’re getting hard to follow.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1400_10": "Oh, I know! Juliana!",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1600_10": "Could you tell us about your journey in Paldea?",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1700_10": "Once we hear your story, I think everything will\nbecome clear!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1800_10": "Oh, uh... OK! I’ll keep it brief.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_1900_10": "So after I moved to Paldea, I started attending\nthe academy.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2000_10": "I met Koraidon on the beach and did a Treasure\nHunt as part of our independent study.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2100_10": "Right, go on!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2200_10": "Then I became friends with Nemona, Arven, and\nPenny, and we all ventured into Area Zero.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2300_10": "I knew it!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2400_10": "I had the same experience in my universe!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2500_10": "What?!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2600_10": "But there were small differences...",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2700_10": "Like the names of our schools, for example.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2800_10": "And it was Miraidon I met on the beach,\nnot Koraidon.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_2900_10": "That’s why I figured they’re parallel universes.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3000_10": "I think I came from a different Paldea than you\nall did!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3100_10": "But I don’t have any proof, so I wouldn’t blame\nyou if you don’t believe me.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3200_10": "Yeah, there’s no way I’d believe that\nbonkers story...",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3300_10": "is what I WOULD say, but after the whole thing\nwith Area Zero...",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3400_10": "Yeah.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3500_10": "I do see how Koraidon and Miraidon are similar.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3600_10": "Soooo...Florian had the same experience as me?\nExcept he’s a boy and has a Miraidon?",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3700_10": "Oh no, Juliana’s brain is overheating.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3800_10": "Hmm. A world that’s a little different...",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_3900_10": "I think I’ve heard a similar story before.",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4005_1001_4000_10": "But you, Brendan...",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4006_1001_0300_10": "Zinnia mentioned something similar!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4006_1001_0400_10": "There’s a different Hoenn from the one we know...",

    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4006_1001_0900_10": "Yeah! That’s why I think what Florian’s saying\nisn’t nonsense!",
    "episode_event_ch0286_ch0287/4006_1001_1000_10": "Yeah, you’re right. I think so too!",
