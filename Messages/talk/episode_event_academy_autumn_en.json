    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4001_1001_1200_10": "I can explain.",

    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1031_0100_10": "We should keep\non learning!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1001_0100_10": "At Pasio Academy, you can learn as a\nstudent no matter your age or experience.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1001_0200_10": "It’s a great system!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1001_0300_10": "We can see firsthand how others teach—and\nhave other teachers observe us. It’s a great\nway to learn!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1001_0400_10": "And I gotta say, sitting at a desk next to\neveryone else really brings me back!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/6801_1001_0500_10": "I bet they’ve got even more great ideas at\nPasio Academy to motivate us!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0100_10": "You’re Jasmine, right? If I’m not mistaken,\nyou’re in my class!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0200_10": "Y-yes, that’s right. I, um... I wanted to ask\na favor of you, Ms. Miriam, since you’re a\nhealth teacher in Paldea.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0300_10": "Could you please teach me how to treat\npeople and Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0400_10": "Why? Hoping to become a doctor?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0500_10": "No, it’s not that...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0600_10": "One time, I had to care for a sick Pokémon...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0700_10": "If I find a Pokémon or person like that again,\nI want to be able to help them.",

    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_0900_10": "You’re so kind, Jasmine!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1000_10": "Oh, um... I-I don’t know about that...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1100_10": "You want to help people and Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1200_10": "Of course I’ll teach you! How could I refuse\nsuch a sweet, kind student?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1300_10": "Really?! Thank you so much!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1400_10": "I bet you’ll learn fast!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1500_10": "When you want to learn something, having a\ngoal or dream can keep you motivated.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1600_10": "I couldn’t agree more!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1700_10": "I’m sure you’ll learn a lot from Ms. Miriam!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1800_10": "Hey, speaking of treating people! You should\ntake a look at Mr. Kabu here!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_1900_10": "What?! Did Mr. Kabu hurt himself too?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2000_10": "Huh... Looks like I did get a scrape.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2100_10": "Maybe it happened when I was hurrying\nto get Ms. Miriam to help Hugh.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2200_10": "Oh goodness! Now that I’ve a better look...\nYou’ve also got little burns on your fingers,\ndon’t you!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2300_10": "Yeah, things got a bit heated in my class.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2400_10": "But when you’re a Fire-type Pokémon user,\nburns come with the territory, right?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2500_10": "No, not “right”!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2600_10": "*sigh* Every school seems to have teachers\nwho are always getting hurt.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2700_10": "Hehehe... Sorry.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2800_10": "Well, this is sooner than I expected, but shall\nwe start studying how to treat injuries—with\nMr. Kabu as our subject?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4002_1001_2900_10": "Um... OK! I’m ready!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0100_10": "OK, that’s all I have for class today.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0200_10": "Got it? When it comes to learning, it’s never\ntoo late—and it’s never over!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0300_10": "Anyone can keep their fire burning!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0400_10": "Believe in your own potential, everyone,\nand keep pushing on!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0500_10": "Wow! That was a class I’ll never forget!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0600_10": "I didn’t just learn facts and stuff. I also\nlearned how important it is to have the\nright mindset!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0700_10": "I, um... I was actually a little worried about\nwhether I could learn things here at\nPasio Academy...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0800_10": "But after listening to Mr. Kabu’s class,\nI’m optimistic!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_0900_10": "I feel the same!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1000_10": "It takes me back to when I was working\nhard to become a health teacher.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1100_10": "I’m so glad I attended this class as a\nstudent today!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1200_10": "Wow, hearing this from you all makes it all\nworth it!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1300_10": "I wish I could teach classes that touch\nstudents’ hearts, like you do.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1400_10": "You’ve got nothing to worry about,\nMs. Miriam!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1500_10": "Need proof? Think of how you looked after\nme when I was injured!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1600_10": "Oh! You’re all healed!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1700_10": "You gave me just the treatment I needed,\nMs. Miriam, and on top of that...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1800_10": "Jasmine kept checking on me and Hugh to\nsee how we were doing.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_1900_10": "I did my best to apply everything you taught\nme, Ms. Miriam!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2000_10": "So I guess that means although Jasmine\ndefinitely put in the effort...",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2100_10": "you also did a great job teaching her!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2200_10": "Huh... You think so?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2300_10": "I guess I could be a proper teacher to at\nleast one student!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2400_10": "Yeah! And I learned that from now on,\nI’ll be OK no matter how injured I get!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2500_10": "Hey! That is NOT the takeaway here! You’re\nsupposed to avoid getting injured in the\nfirst place!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4003_1001_2600_10": "R-right... Sorry, Ms. Miriam!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0100_10": "Mr. Kabu and...Mr. Maxie?!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0200_10": "Wow, is it that time already?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0300_10": "It’s rare to see the two of you together.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0400_10": "Were you having a meeting?",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0500_10": "No, nothing like that. Mr. Maxie is going to\nteach the next class here, and we got to\ntalking.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0600_10": "I only planned on making small talk, but we\nended up having a lively conversation!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0700_10": "We made each other’s acquaintance only\nrecently, but we both have a connection to\nHoenn—and have a lot in common!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0800_10": "Whoa! Cool!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_0900_10": "And I’ve also started using Camerupt more\nduring class here at Pasio Academy.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1000_10": "Mr. Maxie here has a partner Camerupt too,\nso I’ve been getting good reference\nmaterial from his classes.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1100_10": "I too have gained a lot of insight from\nyour classes.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1200_10": "We should continue with each other’s classes\nand learn from one another.",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1300_10": "Yeah, definitely!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1400_10": "All right, time to get going! Off to my\nnext class!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1500_10": "Mr. Kabu is...really fired up!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1600_10": "He sure is. We’d better do our best too!",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1700_10": "“Keep learning and training as long as\nyou’re alive...”",
    "episode_event_academy_autumn/4004_1001_1800_10": "Yeah! I’m getting fired up too!"
