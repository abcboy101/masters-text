    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_0700_10": "All three of these Dragonite are my Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_0800_10": "Just now, I was having all of them train together.",

    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_0301_1200_10": "The one in the middle!",

    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_0402_1500_10": "Heh. You’ve still got work to do!",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_1600_10": "The answer is...this one!",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_1700_10": "Other Trainers may not see a huge difference...",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_1800_10": "but I can see clearly what sets each one apart\nfrom the others.",

    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2100_10": "Not to brag, but I went through a lot to raise them\ninto the strong, reliable Pokémon they are now.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2200_10": "I trained the three of them together and kept\nchallenging really tough Trainers over and\nover again!",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2300_10": "When they were still Dratini and Dragonair, we\nlost a fair share of those battles...",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2400_10": "I also battled Red and Blue with two Dragonair,\nwhen we first met.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2500_10": "I have different memories of raising each of my\nDragonite—good ones and rough ones.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2600_10": "We continued to gain experience and grow\ntogether, which brought us to where we are now.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2700_10": "Because of the way I bonded with these Dragonite\nI raised...",

    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_2900_10": "That said, I don’t think this is the best we can do\nas a sync pair, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_3000_10": "We’ve gained a new power with this arc suit, but\nI can’t get complacent...",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_3100_10": "I plan on always aiming higher.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_3200_10": "It would be the best feeling ever to strengthen my\nbonds with my other Dragonite and battle beside\nthem in my arc suit!",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_3300_10": "The time you spend with your Pokémon will\nbecome precious memories that will help you\ngrow as a sync pair.",
    "charaepi_ch0111_90_wataru/2301_1201_3400_10": "Don’t forget to cherish your Pokémon,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]...",
