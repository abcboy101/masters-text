    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2100_10": "He once became the Galar Champion and was\nnamed “Steel Peony”...",
    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2200_10": "But we haven’t kept in touch, so I don’t know\nwhere he is or what he’s been up to.",
    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2300_10": "My apologies. There are times when adults like my\nbrother and I just can’t seem to have an honest\ndiscussion. Sometimes our pride gets in the way.",
    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2400_10": "Oh, that’s right!",
    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2500_10": "I may not look it, but I used to be quite the Trainer\nmyself long ago.",
    "charaepi_ch0262_00_rose/2301_1201_2600_10": "I even came in second place in the Galar League!",
