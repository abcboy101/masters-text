    "episode_event_summer_2024/4003_1001_0500_10": "Oh! I didn’t know there was a cave over there!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4003_1001_0600_10": "It looks awfully suspicious... My treasure sense is\ntingling!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4003_1001_0700_10": "I need to search that cave before any other\nTrainers find it!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_1300_10": "I saw you go into this cave, Gardenia, so I\nfollowed you out of curiosity...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_1400_10": "I don’t suppose you found the treasure already,\ndid you?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_1500_10": "No, not yet. But I still haven’t checked out the\ndeeper parts of the cave yet.",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_1900_10": "You mean a ghost Pokémon? Then let’s go check\nit out!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_2000_10": "Knowing Lear, he might have gotten a Pokémon to\nguard the treasure.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_2100_10": "Uhh... Well...",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4004_1001_2500_10": "I’ve got Jellicent with me, and Palossand is inside\nher Poké Ball, so I’ll be OK!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0100_10": "Hurry up, Gardenia!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0200_10": "W-Wait, Acerola... You walk too fast!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0300_10": "No, you’re just slow!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0400_10": "Are you sure you’re not scared of ghosts?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0500_10": "O-Of course! I’m not the least bit scared!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0600_10": "Huh? You suuure?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0700_10": "Sure I’m sure! Just watch me!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0800_10": "Eek!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_0900_10": "... ... ...",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4005_1001_1100_10": "*sniffle*\nThanks, Acerola...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0100_10": "Well, here we are—the depths of the cave...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0200_10": "Now, to find that treasure...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0300_10": "Wait a minute... Who’s that Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0400_10": "It’s Dhelmise!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0500_10": "So that’s what was making those noises!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0600_10": "You mean those were just Pokémon cries all\nalong? Thank goodness...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0700_10": "I thought for sure it was a ghost...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0800_10": "Huh? But Dhelmise IS a ghost Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_0900_10": "Huh? Really?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1000_10": "Still, though...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1100_10": "I’m not sure why, but unlike other ghost Pokémon,\nit’s not that scary to me...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1200_10": "That must be because Dhelmise is ALSO a\nGrass-type Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1300_10": "Oh, I see! If it’s a Grass-type Pokémon, then\neven I...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1400_10": "A-actually, it is kinda scary...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1500_10": "Well, now we know what was making that noise,\nbut I don’t see any treasure here. Do you?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1600_10": "No. So, what’s Dhelmise doing here?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1700_10": "I don’t see a Trainer anywhere, and it doesn’t\nseem like Lear put it here to guard the treasure...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1800_10": "Hmm... Maybe it’s a wild Pokémon that got lost\nand somehow ended up on Pasio.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_1900_10": "I know, Gardenia! Why don’t you become a sync\npair with Dhelmise?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2000_10": "Whaaa—?! Me?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2100_10": "It’s not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type\nPokémon on your team!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2200_10": "Me with a ghost Pokémon... Could I really become\na sync pair with Dhelmise?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2300_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2400_10": "Eep!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2500_10": "Oh! Wait, Dhelmise!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2600_10": "I think I might have hurt Dhelmise’s feelings...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2700_10": "You didn’t want Dhelmise as your partner?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2800_10": "That’s not it—I want to get to know Dhelmise\nbetter.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_2900_10": "It’s just...I really do have hang-ups about ghosts...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_3000_10": "...You know what? I want to find Dhelmise again\nso I can set things straight!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_3100_10": "Yeah, let’s go find it and apologize!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_3200_10": "Go, Jellicent! Follow that Dhelmise!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_3300_10": "Let’s go, Gardenia!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4006_1001_3400_10": "Right!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0100_10": "Jellicent led us out of the cave...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0200_10": "But all I see out here are sync pairs caught up in\nthe treasure hunt!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0300_10": "Maybe Dhelmise is hiding underwater.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0400_10": "Oh, of course! It must be in the sea!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0500_10": "How do you think we could get Dhelmise to come\nout?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0600_10": "Easy! We go fishing!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0700_10": "Huh?! Fishing?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0800_10": "I mean, I understand the logic...but where are we\ngoing to get a fishing rod?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_0900_10": "Let’s see... She should be fishing around here\nsomewhere...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1000_10": "There she is! Hey! Lanaaa!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1100_10": "Oh my. What’s going on here?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1200_10": "Listen, Lana! We’ve got a favor to ask...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1300_10": "Ah, so that’s what you’re after.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1400_10": "In that case, please, go right ahead and use my\nfishing rod.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1500_10": "Are you sure, Lana? Weren’t you using your fishing\nrod to look for the treasure?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1600_10": "Oh, I’ve got plenty of fishing rods—all handmade\nLana originals!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1700_10": "I always carry a few around to share with anyone\nwho’s interested in fishing.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1800_10": "I hope you land a big catch and reel in\nthat Dhelmise!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_1900_10": "Thank you, Lana!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4007_1001_2000_10": "Just watch—I’ll fish up Dhelmise for sure!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0100_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0200_10": "Hey, Lana, is it hard to fish up a Dhelmise?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0300_10": "I certainly wouldn’t expect it to be easy.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0400_10": "But in this case, you know where Dhelmise is,\nright?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0500_10": "Yes! Jellicent showed us!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0600_10": "Then I don’t think it should take too long.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0700_10": "I...I think something’s tugging the line!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0800_10": "You’ve got it! Now pull with all your strength!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_0900_10": "Nnngh!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1000_10": "...No good! I can’t pull it any closer!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1100_10": "Acerola! Let’s help her!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1200_10": "Right!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1300_10": "Three, two, one...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1400_10": "Nnngh!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1500_10": "No use. I don’t think we’re making any headway...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1600_10": "I didn’t realize Dhelmise was so heavy...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1700_10": "Then let’s get more people to help us!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1800_10": "Hold on, Gardenia! We’re going to get help!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_1900_10": "Got it!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4008_1001_2000_10": "B-but...please hurry!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0100_10": "Sorry to keep you waiting, Gardenia! We brought\nsome people we found nearby!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0300_10": "Let me lend you a hand!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0400_10": "We want to help, too!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0500_10": "My brother and I are perfectly in sync, so I think\nwe could be of assistance!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0600_10": "I may not be much help, but I’ll do whatever\nI can!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0700_10": "Thank you, everyone! With all of us working\ntogether, we’ll definitely be able to do this!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_0800_10": "All right, everyone! On three!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4009_1001_1700_10": "And I brought help—including a strapping young\nswimmer!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_3400_10": "Yeah. Seems like it got tangled up with Dhelmise.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_3500_10": "I’ve been observing your activities this entire\ntime!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_3600_10": "And I have decided—the winners of this treasure\nhunt are Gardenia and Acerola!",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_3800_10": "Are you sure it’s OK?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_3900_10": "We were only able to fish up that treasure in the\nfirst place thanks to everyone’s help...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4000_10": "But you two were the first to find it.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4100_10": "All we did was help!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4200_10": "More importantly, though—what about that\n“generous reward,” Lear?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4300_10": "Heh heh... You’ve been curious about that, have\nyou?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4400_10": "The prize for this event is...",

    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4700_10": "Can you even THINK of a more prestigious prize\nthan a statue of me, the owner of Pasio?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4800_10": "I feel like something similar to this has happened\nbefore...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_4900_10": "Which means—!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5000_10": "I was right! There are rare stones being used as\nembellishments here!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5100_10": "Hey, what do you say we give this statue to\nSteven?",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5200_10": "I don’t think the two of us would get much use out\nof it anyway...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5300_10": "Yeah! Great idea!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5400_10": "Steven, you can have that statue if you like.",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5500_10": "Huh? Are you sure?!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5600_10": "Yes, of course! After all...",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5700_10": "we already found an even more precious treasure!",
    "episode_event_summer_2024/4010_1001_5800_10": "Right, Dhelmise?"
