    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_2300_10": "So the relationship that people and Pokémon have\nin this space isn’t so different, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_0301_2400_10": "Pokémon are friends!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_0401_2500_10": "Yeah! They’re friends—and also family! We’ll live\ntogether with them forever and ever!",

    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_2800_10": "I want Glaceon and I to really understand each\nother—just as much as any other sync pair\non Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_2900_10": "The world really is a vast place... There are so\nmany things to see that I never knew about.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_3000_10": "I want to tell everyone in Hisui that using Poké\nBalls to coexist with Pokémon isn’t a mistake!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_3100_10": "So with that in mind, Glaceon and I have to be\nPoké Ball pioneers...",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_3200_10": "as the Pearl Clan’s first sync pair!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_00_kai/2301_1201_3300_10": "There’s just one small issue.",
