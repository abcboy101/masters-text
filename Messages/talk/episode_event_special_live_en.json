    "episode_event_special_live/4006_1001_2200_10": "How about you, Plumeria?",
    "episode_event_special_live/4006_1001_2300_10": "Honestly, your feelings just come off to me as\nidealistic talk...",
    "episode_event_special_live/4006_1001_2400_10": "But...I don’t hate it.",
    "episode_event_special_live/4006_1001_2500_10": "I guess it might not be so bad to motivate the\ngrunts with your music.",

    "episode_event_special_live/4006_1001_3300_10": "Let’s rock the audience right outta their seats\ntogether!",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_0100_10": "The reason I thought of introducing you to\nthese two is because of Mightyena and\nHoundoom’s howls.",

    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_0300_10": "But by partnering with you, they exchanged the\nstrength of being part of a pack for the strength of\nbeing independent.",

    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_0600_10": "I hear you, but...I have no music knowledge at all,\nyou know?",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_0700_10": "Neither do I...",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_0800_10": "Are you OK with that, Piers?",

    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1000_10": "The two of you understand how tough the world of\nbattling can be...",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1100_10": "So you’ll still be able to move the crowd, even\nwithout a strong grasp of music.",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1200_10": "I see...then I’m all in.",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1300_10": "It’ll be interesting to take on a challenge and see\nwhether we succeed or fail.",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1400_10": "Hmm... That’s how it is, huh?",
    "episode_event_special_live/4007_1001_1500_10": "Then yeah, I’ll join you too—though I’ll do it at\nmy own pace. As long as I can have some fun, I\ndon’t mind.",
