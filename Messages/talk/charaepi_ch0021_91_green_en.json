    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_1201_0600_10": "Wanna know why?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_1201_0700_10": "Pidgeot’s been my Pokémon since Kanto.",

    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_1201_1000_10": "And I can’t lose to my protégés!",
    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_1201_1100_10": "So I’m having folks from Johto who helped\nwhip them into shape battle me, too!",

    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_0302_2100_10": "What if you turned the tables in your\nfavor?",
    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_0402_2200_10": "Makes sense. I bet I could catch them off\nguard if I used a move effective against\nPikachu.",
    "charaepi_ch0021_91_green/2301_0402_2300_10": "I’m gonna think up a strategy that’ll make\nRed sweat!",
