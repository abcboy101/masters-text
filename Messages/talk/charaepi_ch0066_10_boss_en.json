    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_2400_10": "It, like me, has SUPERB taste in treasures!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_2500_10": "We bonded over our shared appreciation of\ntreasure and formed a sync pair!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_2600_10": "Ooooh, so you became friends because you have\nsimilar tastes! That sounds fun!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_2700_10": "If I remember correctly, in order to evolve\nGimmighoul into Gholdengo...",

    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_3500_10": "It would be, if those two weren’t always playing\npranks all over Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_1201_3600_10": "It was a pain to manage when it was just\nHoopa! But now that Gholdengo is getting\ninvolved, they’re incorrigible!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_0301_3700_10": "Sounds like they’re\nlivening things up!",
    "charaepi_ch0066_10_boss/2301_0401_3800_10": "How dare you! You think just because this isn’t\nyour problem that you can speak out of turn?!",
