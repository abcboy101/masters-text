    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_0200_10": "Oh? [Name:PlayerNickname ], are\nyou here to train, too?",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_0300_10": "Terastallizing... It’s a new kind of\npower for us.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_0400_10": "But if we use it well, I think it’ll give us\nmore ways to battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_0500_10": "Hm? Oh, curious what Typhlosion’s\nlooking at?",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_0600_10": "They say Hisuian Typhlosion can see\nthings people can’t!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0301_0700_10": "I wonder what.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0401_0800_10": "I hear they can see things like life\nenergy—and spirits!",

    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0402_1000_10": "Yup. Apparently, they can see things like\nspirits and life energy.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_1100_10": "That’s why in Hisui, people believe they\npurify lost, forsaken souls with their\nflames and guide them to the afterlife.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_1200_10": "Maybe they can see the strange bonds\nthat bring people and Pokémon together.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_1300_10": "I like to think that’s how I met\nTyphlosion, anyway. We met on Pasio\nin a space-time distortion.",

    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_1500_10": "I’ve always thought I should treasure\neach encounter...and I’m sure I’ll keep\nthinking that way.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_1600_10": "New power, new encounters...\nIt all makes me so happy!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0301_1700_10": "Pretty neat, Typhlosion!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0401_1800_10": "If Typhlosion is happy, I’m happy.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0302_1900_10": "What a great partner!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_0402_2000_10": "Yup! And I hope that’s how Typhlosion\nsees me, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2100_10": "I have to thank Typhlosion for showing\nme more of this great wide world!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2200_10": "Thanks to her, my world’s even broader.",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2300_10": "The people on Pasio and the Terastal\nphenomenon are so different from Hisui,\nI never could’ve imagined them!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2400_10": "But no matter how vast the differences...",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2500_10": "I’m positive the bonds between people\nand Pokémon can overcome them!",
    "charaepi_ch0285_41_kai/2301_1201_2600_10": "Just like with me, Typhlosion, and you,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!"
