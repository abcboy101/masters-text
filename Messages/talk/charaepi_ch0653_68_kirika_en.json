    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_0300_10": "Yes! I’d like a furisode that’s inspired\nby my partner Pokémon so we can\nbetter understand each other’s feelings!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_0400_10": "That’s a good idea... But I think you should design\nthat yourself, Kali.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_0500_10": "What, me?",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_0600_10": "You’re the one who knows the most about\nAzumarill, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_0700_10": "I-I know, but... I’m not confident enough yet...",

    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_1000_10": "Can I leave Kali with you for a bit?",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0301_1100_10": "Of course!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0401_1200_10": "Hehe, I appreciate it.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0302_1300_10": "Leave it to me!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0402_1400_10": "Hehe, how reliable!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_1500_10": "Well then, see you later, you two. I’ll be cheering\nyou on.",

    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0402_2100_10": "That’s right. I can’t give up before I start.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_2200_10": "Um... Then, could I formally ask you to help me\ndesign my furisode?",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_2300_10": "Valerie is always thinking about what’s best\nfor us.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_2400_10": "And she asked you to take care of me.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_2500_10": "That means she trusts you very much.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_2600_10": "So, I think with you, I can make a furisode that I’d\nbe proud of!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0301_2700_10": "Challenging yourself is important!",

    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0302_2900_10": "Even if we mess up, let’s learn\nfrom it!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_0402_3000_10": "That’s right! Experience is everything, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3100_10": "Maybe I was comparing myself with Valerie and\nputting myself down...",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3200_10": "Even if my skills aren’t perfect, I’ve got to do what\nI can, especially for my partner Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3300_10": "Because of you, I can move forward with this,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3400_10": "I can see why Valerie thinks so highly of you.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3500_10": "OK then, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Let’s battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3600_10": "I am the one who tests who has the skills to\nchallenge Valerie.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3700_10": "But she’s already approved of you, even though\nyou haven’t battled me.",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3800_10": "And that’s frustrating!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_3900_10": "Also, I’d like to get to know you better!",

    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_4400_10": "Prepare yourself!",
    "charaepi_ch0653_68_kirika/2301_1201_4500_10": "I’m gonna show you a battle so beautiful, you\nwon’t be able to describe it with mere words!"
