    "ch0160_10_suiren/7101_0701_01_10": "The fragrant aroma of flowers is the source of\nTapu Lele’s energy, so it often goes looking\nfor them.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7101_0701_02_10": "Would you like to come with us?",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7101_0701_03_10": "It’s relaxing and energizing!",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7102_0701_01_10": "Mallow and Kiawe said this sygna suit\nlooks pretty.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7102_0701_02_10": "I’m not used to frilly clothes, but I do enjoy praise.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7103_0701_01_10": "My sisters are both very young and immediately\nsay what comes to mind.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7103_0701_02_10": "Although they’re cute, their innocence can be scary.",

    "ch0160_10_suiren/7104_0701_02_10": "But when Tapu Lele sprinkled its scales over him,\nhe perked right up.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/7104_0701_03_10": "He went back out to the water in good health.\nMaybe he’ll return the favor someday.",

    "ch0160_10_suiren/2501_0701_01_10": "Tapu Lele, the guardian deity of Akala, looks\ncute...but it can be guilelessly cruel.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2501_0701_02_10": "Its scales have a healing effect, and it sprinkles\nthem on people and Pokémon for its own\namusement, but...",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2501_0701_03_10": "If you touch too many at once, your body can’t\nkeep up.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2501_0701_04_10": "I’m not joking, by the way. It’s true.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2501_0702_01_10": "My Tapu Lele is different from the one that’s the\nguardian deity of Akala.",

    "ch0160_10_suiren/2511_0701_03_10": "How do I look? Does it suit me?",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2511_0702_01_10": "Alola can be quite warm, so a lot of people wear\nlighter clothes.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/2511_0702_02_10": "But the people on Pasio come from all over, so\nthey wear all sorts of things. It’s fun to see!",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/3001_0701_01_10": "*yawn* Oh dear. Is my yawn catching?",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/3003_0701_01_10": "I saw some incredible splashes in the sea. They\nmust have been made by a strapping\nyoung swimmer.",
    "ch0160_10_suiren/3005_0701_01_10": "Good evening. I’m glad to see you looking lively,\nbut be sure to get some rest tonight."
