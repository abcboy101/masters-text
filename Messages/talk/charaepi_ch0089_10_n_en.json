    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_1100_10": "According to legend, a meteorite fell from the sky,\nand that’s what created it.",

    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_1600_10": "Kyurem is what remains of the body of what used\nto be a single Pokémon that split into Reshiram\nand Zekrom.",

    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_2200_10": "It’s true that Kyurem can fuse with Zekrom and\nReshiram, so...",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_2300_10": "There seems to be no doubt that they’re\nrelated, too...",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_2400_10": "I tried asking Kyurem to see if I could learn\nanything from it...",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_2500_10": "But it seems like it’s not too sure where it came\nfrom, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_2600_10": "What do you think?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_0301_2700_10": "I think Zekrom also came from space.",

    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_0401_2900_10": "It’s an interesting one, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_0302_3000_10": "Maybe both theories are correct?",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_0402_3100_10": "I see. That’s one way of interpreting it.",
    "charaepi_ch0089_10_n/2301_1201_3200_10": "We don’t really know what the truth is, at least\nfor now.",
