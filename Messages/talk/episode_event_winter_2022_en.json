    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2300_10": "Oh! You see, Ethan helped me out once before,\nwhen another Ampharos was sick.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2400_10": "He got medicine for us.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2500_10": "But this Ampharos is different from Amphy at\nOlivine City’s lighthouse.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2600_10": "There was a Mareep the lighthouse keeper was\nraising as Amphy’s successor.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2700_10": "I started to look after her, and she evolved\ninto Ampharos.",

    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_2900_10": "To shine her light across the ocean from the\nlighthouse and protect the boats at sea.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_3000_10": "But first things first. For that to happen, we need\nAmpharos to get better.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4003_1001_3100_10": "OK then! Let’s get started with the prep!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0100_10": "So, I want you to cook up a feast for our party.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0200_10": "No problem. That will be a piece of cake.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0300_10": "OK! Great!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0400_10": "And...I have another thing I’d like to ask.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0500_10": "You’re a cook, so you must have different kinds\nof ingredients, right?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0600_10": "There’s a certain one that I’m looking for...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0700_10": "Ingredients?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0800_10": "I don’t mind giving you ingredients, but I can’t\nassure you I’ll have what you need...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_0900_10": "Oh, no worries! If you don’t have it, I’ll just go out\nand look for it!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1000_10": "I see.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1100_10": "By the way, your outfit stands out quite a bit.\nAre you going to wear that to the party?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1200_10": "Yup! Ain’t it the cutest?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1300_10": "If I stand next to Sawsbuck, it’s a\ncuteness overload!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1400_10": "I got her from a Trainer in Unova...and when I\nfirst met her, she was a small Deerling.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1500_10": "She was just the cutest thing ever, so I raised her\ngood, and now she’s evolved into a\nsplendid Sawsbuck!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1600_10": "When the two of us are together, everyone falls in\nlove with us!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1700_10": "It’s true that you attract attention...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1800_10": "But I can’t determine whether that’s because\nyou look fascinating or because you look strange...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_1900_10": "Hey! What’s with that comment?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2000_10": "You should say stuff like, “Oh that outfit really suits\nyou!” Or maybe...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2100_10": "“You look cute!” You need to praise\nus first...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2200_10": "Whoa! The light over there went out!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2300_10": "It’s a blackout!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2400_10": "A blackout?! But why?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4004_1001_2500_10": "I wonder if Jasmine’s OK with\nher lights...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0100_10": "Oops... I must’ve upped the voltage too much...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0200_10": "I came here hoping this wouldn’t be the case, but\nit seems the reason for the blackout is here...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0300_10": "I thought maybe you could use these new lights I\ninvented as decorations...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0400_10": "But it seems Pasio’s power grid couldn’t handle\nthe burden.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0500_10": "Did you ask Volkner to help out with the lights?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0600_10": "Y-yes... Since Volkner is an electrical expert,\nI thought to ask him for help...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0700_10": "I met Volkner when I stopped by the lighthouse in\nSunyshore City...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0800_10": "And I also heard rumors about him, so...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_0900_10": "Rumors? Like what?",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1000_10": "Um... That you, uh...stand out, in many ways...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1100_10": "Hahaha! In many ways? That’s true!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1200_10": "People don’t just mean his Pokémon battles,\ndo they.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1300_10": "Though, it is a shame.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1400_10": "There were other inventions I wanted to try out...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1500_10": "What kind of inventions?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1600_10": "I’m proud of them.",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1700_10": "Using this one, we can double or even—",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1800_10": "N-normal is fine! Normal lights will be just fine!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_1900_10": "You sure? Never mind, then...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_2000_10": "I kinda wanted to see what it would look like...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_2100_10": "I suppose having too much expertise can also be\ntroublesome at times...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4005_1001_2200_10": "I agree...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0100_10": "OK then! That’s all for today!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0200_10": "Phew. I’m so tired...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0300_10": "Battling a Champion is really tiring...",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0400_10": "As promised, this is to thank you for accepting\nmy challenge!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0500_10": "Thanks a bunch, Mister Champion!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4006_1201_0600_10": "I heard you’re preparing for a party, so why do\nyou need that?",

    "episode_event_winter_2022/4008_1201_0800_10": "It’s a medicine that’ll give you a boost of energy,\nmade by yours truly!",
    "episode_event_winter_2022/4008_1201_0900_10": "I used Moomoo Milk as the base and added all\nsorts of other things—Honey, Lum Berries,\na Revive...",
