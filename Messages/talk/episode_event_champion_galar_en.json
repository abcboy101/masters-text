    "episode_event_champion_galar/4006_1001_0300_10": "There simply wasn’t anyone who could match\nmy skills.",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_0500_10": "Raihan and Sonia, and not just them...",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_0700_10": "Those words are enough for me.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_0800_10": "For you to acknowledge our skills, Leon...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_0900_10": "It’s just as good as becoming the Neo Champion!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1000_10": "We also want to see everyone’s conviction—and\nface it head on!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1100_10": "That’s why we took you up on your offer.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1200_10": "I guess I was right in asking you two.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1300_10": "But there sure is a lot of pressure, isn’t there!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1400_10": "I bet Hop and the others are just burning to\nbeat us.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1500_10": "Yeah, I can definitely see that!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1600_10": "Are you looking forward to battling Hop the most?",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1700_10": "Of course! We’re rivals, after all!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1800_10": "That’s why we’re gonna battle all out with\nno regrets!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_1900_10": "Yes! I feel the same way!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4007_1001_2000_10": "Right! Let’s train so we can be ready to take on\nthe challengers!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0100_10": "So our opponents are Lee, Victor, and Gloria.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0200_10": "We won’t win by just attacking randomly.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0300_10": "It’d help if they had a weakness or habit...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0400_10": "Habit, huh...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0500_10": "Honestly, Lee is so strong, I’m not sure we could\nbeat him three-on-one...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0600_10": "But in a heated battle, he can sometimes get so\ninto it that he gets tunnel vision!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0700_10": "Gloria is very strong on offense...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0800_10": "But I think her defense could be better.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_0900_10": "Victor always makes the optimal choice in battle,\nand he usually takes the win.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1000_10": "Just thinking about it is getting on my nerves.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1100_10": "Yeah! That IS how Victor battles!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1200_10": "Which means there’s a good chance Victor will\nbe the one calling the shots!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1300_10": "Smart thinking! I’d expect no less from someone\nwho’s gonna be the best professor!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1400_10": "But that’s his strength. Does Victor have any\nweaknesses?",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1500_10": "Let’s see...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1600_10": "There are times when he overthinks tactics, which\ncan slightly delay his instructions to his Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1700_10": "I’ve got an idea!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1800_10": "I see. Good plan.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_1900_10": "We might be able to catch the three of them off\nguard that way.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_2000_10": "Right! If we use that plan against Lee’s team...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_2100_10": "we’ll absolutely take them down!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_2200_10": "Of course. I won’t tolerate failure.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4008_1001_2300_10": "Now then, let’s start our final push!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1101_0100_20": "On the day of the tournament...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1101_0200_20": "The challengers were attacking relentlessly!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1101_0300_20": "And facing them were the Champion team,\nwho’d been steadily but consistently battling\ntheir way through any and all opponents.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0400_10": "Seems you’re serious about taking the\nNeo Champion title!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0500_10": "You being the only Champion of Galar is a bit\nboring, right?",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0600_10": "Today’s the day we wash away all the\nfrustrations we’ve had up till now!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0700_10": "Champion Leon...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0800_10": "I’ll be getting my revenge for that humiliating\ndefeat at that stadium in Galar!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_0900_10": "So brace yourself!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1000_10": "Not gonna get me with that!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1100_10": "Huh?!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1200_10": "We’re here, too!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1300_10": "So don’t forget about us!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1400_10": "Darn...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1500_10": "No way!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1600_10": "What?! I’m the only one left?!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4009_1001_1700_10": "Y-you took them both out?!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0100_10": "Gordie! Piers!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0200_10": "Yeah, request queued up.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0300_10": "Let’s show them our bond’s as strong as\na monolith!",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0500_10": "We can’t let our opponents use the field to their\nadvantage! Leon! Gloria!",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0700_10": "Sure thing!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0800_10": "Nope, I can’t let that happen. We’ve got to win.",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_0900_10": "(Please watch this, Sis!)",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_1000_10": "Raihan! Gordie! Now’s your chance! Go!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_1100_10": "Leave it to me!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_1200_10": "All right!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_1300_10": "Quite impressive, but...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4010_1001_1400_10": "I guess there’s no encore...",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4012_1001_0300_10": "Have a taste of our true power!\nDon’t take us lightly, Lee!",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4012_1001_0400_10": "Sorry, but we’re gonna win today, Gloria!",

    "episode_event_champion_galar/4012_1001_0800_10": "Heh. Now, time to begin...",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4012_1001_0900_10": "Oh no! Everyone—",
    "episode_event_champion_galar/4012_1001_1000_10": "Articuno! Stop Rillaboom from moving!",
