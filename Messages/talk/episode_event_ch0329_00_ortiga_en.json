    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_0600_10": "Oh? How’d you come up with that?",
    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_0700_10": "Sometimes, students want a say in what they\nlearn—AND who from—right?",

    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_1000_10": "So maybe at Pasio Academy, it’d be nice if the\nteachers weren’t stuck being the teacher all the\ntime.",
    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_1100_10": "Plus, teaching isn’t one-sided.",
    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_1200_10": "Teachers can learn—and grow—from students,\ntoo!",

    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_2700_10": "We were searching for individuals who could\ninspire curiosity and tenacity—who could teach\nstudents to find their very own treasure!",

    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4008_1001_3200_10": "But I’ll allow it! Let’s do it!",
    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4009_1001_0100_10": "We ran into a few challenges getting the academy\nup and running.",

    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4009_1001_0500_10": "All right. Say it with me...",
    "episode_event_ch0329_00_ortiga/4009_1001_0600_10": "Hasta la vistar! ★"
