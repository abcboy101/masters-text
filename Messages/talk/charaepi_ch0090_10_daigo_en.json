    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1101_0200_20": "Steven appeared to be talking to Deoxys...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_0300_10": "Listen, Deoxys, this is a very rare meteor.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_0400_10": "It’s a precious meteor that Sophocles had \nstored away.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_0500_10": "The results of our analysis showed that it\ncontains a very rare metal. And do you know\nhow valuable it—",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_0600_10": "Just as I thought...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0301_0700_10": "What’s up?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0401_0800_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nThere’s something I’ve been curious about.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0302_0900_10": "What did you find?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0402_1000_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! I’m still looking\ninto researching this more, but I’ve noticed\nsomething interesting!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1100_10": "Before, when I tried to feed this \nmeteor to Rayquaza...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1200_10": "Deoxys was watching us intently.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1300_10": "So I thought it was interested in rocks and\ndid some experimenting...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1400_10": "Apparently, Deoxys is interested in the meteor,\nnot rocks.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1500_10": "Here, watch this!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1600_10": "It looks like it’s happy, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1700_10": "Whenever I show Deoxys a meteor, it reacts in\ninteresting ways.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_1800_10": "It’s gotten excited, irritated... Even mad, for\nsome reason.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0301_1900_10": "Very weird!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0401_2000_10": "Right? Also, I haven’t managed to find any sort\nof correlation at all between the type of meteor\nand Deoxys’s reaction.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0302_2100_10": "That’s so cute!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0402_2200_10": "I know, right? It makes me happy that it shows me\ndifferent facial expressions!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_2300_10": "In fact, Deoxys can change its form to adapt to a\nvariety of things.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_2400_10": "Maybe it’s using the energy of the stone to change\nits form, just like Mega Evolution.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_2500_10": "Well... That was my thinking as a Trainer, but the\ntruth is much more simple.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0301_2600_10": "Simple?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0401_2700_10": "What I mean is, Pokémon are just like humans.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0302_2800_10": "The truth?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_0402_2900_10": "Well, maybe not the truth—more like what I hope \nis the case.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_3000_10": "They say that Deoxys is a Pokémon that emerged\nfrom a space virus that mutated.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_3100_10": "So I think it just feels nostalgic about the meteor,\nwhich reminds it of its homeland.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_3200_10": "Anyway, I’m happy I’m starting to understand\nDeoxys little by little.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_3300_10": "Even though sometimes it almost gets into huge\nfights with Rayquaza over the meteors...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_10_daigo/2301_1201_3400_10": "It looks like it’s having so much fun every day\nbecause it met a fellow rock lover!"
