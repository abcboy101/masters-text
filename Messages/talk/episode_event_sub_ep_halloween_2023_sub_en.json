    "episode_event_sub_ep_halloween_2023_sub/4003_1201_1100_10": "Well, it’d be nice if we could give Cofagrigus\nwhat they want to eat every day...",
    "episode_event_sub_ep_halloween_2023_sub/4003_1201_1200_10": "But unfortunately, only a king could do that.",

    "episode_event_sub_ep_halloween_2023_sub/4003_1201_1600_10": "Hmm?",
