    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_0300_10": "What do you think, Clodsire?",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_0400_10": "You don’t much care for this place after all, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_0500_10": "If only there were a big marsh or swamp...\nAt this point I’d even take a pond.",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_0301_0600_10": "I know a pond!",

    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_0302_0900_10": "I’ll show you a good spot!",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_0402_1000_10": "Really?! You know a good spot around here?",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_0402_1100_10": "You’re a real lifesaver.",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_1200_10": "I should’ve asked for your help from the get-go,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",

    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_0402_2000_10": "Huh. Flatter reaction than I expected. Figured I’d\nget SOME kinda rise outta you, at least.",
    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_2100_10": "Anyway, I may have been exaggerating just a tad,\nbut it’s still important to be careful. Safety first\nand all that.",

    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_2700_10": "Don’t let that fool you, though—if he’s attacked by\nan enemy, he’ll stick out these thick spines to\nretaliate.",

    "charaepi_ch0302_00_chiri/2301_1201_3100_10": "Take you, for example... Maybe you’ve got a\nhidden side behind that smiling face of yours.",
