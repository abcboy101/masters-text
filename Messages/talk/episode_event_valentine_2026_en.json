    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_1400_10": "Hmm... Which would she appreciate more?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_1500_10": "*chuckle* I’m surprised even you can feel\nstuck sometimes, Rika!",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_1900_10": "Between your serious side and your playful\nside, which is the real you?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2000_10": "Hmm. Tough question.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2100_10": "Both are true parts of me.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2500_10": "Huh? Are you saying you’re two-faced,\nKaty?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2600_10": "Oh no, nothing like that. I just mean my two\nsides as a Gym Leader.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2700_10": "Most of the time, I go soft on Trainers,\nat La Primera’s request.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2800_10": "But I also want to show my true skill!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_2900_10": "That’s what my sweet little bugs want, too!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_3000_10": "Yeah, it’s important to honor both.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_3100_10": "Which is why I don’t think you have to stick\nto just one version of yourself!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_3200_10": "But if it’s hard for you to switch mindsets...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4003_1001_3300_10": "I’ve got just the idea!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1101_0100_20": "On Palentine’s Day...",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_0600_10": "Nahahaha! Must be ’cause I leveled up this\nbeauty of mine with this special outfit!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_0700_10": "You’re looking pretty spiffy yourself,\nAdaman.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1300_10": "And I take it they also made yours?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1400_10": "Yup. Katy introduced me to them.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1500_10": "Apparently, that Atticus kid wants to become\na fashion designer.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1600_10": "I hope he gives it his all and achieves\nhis dream!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1700_10": "Yeah!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1800_10": "Anyway, time wasted is lost! Let’s get going!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_1900_10": "Oh yeah, I better bring those sweets Katy\ngave me.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2000_10": "Hey, Misty! Got a sec?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2100_10": "Whoa! Rika?! Is that you?!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2200_10": "I look extra pretty today, don’t I?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2300_10": "You look amazing!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2400_10": "Since it’s Palentine’s Day, I wanted to say\nthanks...",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2600_10": "Oh! Is that Quagsire...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_2700_10": "You guessed it! She’s the Wooper you gave\nme. Can you believe how big she is?",

    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_3100_10": "Come on—our turn!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_3200_10": "Hm? You want to know where Sylveon\ncame from?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2026/4004_1001_3300_10": "Can’t you tell? He’s the Eevee I introduced\nyou to the other day. He evolved!",
