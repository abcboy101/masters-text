    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0300_10": "Curious what Munchlax is eating?",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0400_10": "Actually, these are food scraps restaurants\nplanned to throw away.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0500_10": "Don’t worry about Munchlax, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0600_10": "He won’t get sick from this. Munchlax may\nhave insatiable appetites, but they’ve got\nrobust stomachs.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0700_10": "Back in Hisui, he’d even gobble up all the\nfood scraps intended for compost!",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0800_10": "Even after coming to Pasio, he’s still always\nhungry, and I think some people noticed...",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_0900_10": "’Cause a bunch of the restaurant staff\naround here adore him and started giving\nhim their leftovers and scraps.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1000_10": "Ever since, we’ve made sure to pass by here\nwhenever we go for a walk.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1100_10": "I do feel a little bad, though, since they’re\nalways giving us stuff.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1200_10": "Looks like you finished everything today,\nas usual! Good job!",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1300_10": "He seems pretty pleased and full now.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_0301_1400_10": "You really understand him!",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_0401_1500_10": "Well, we’ve spent a lot of time together,\nhelping each other out.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_0302_1600_10": "You can really tell what Munchlax is\nfeeling!",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_0402_1700_10": "Of course! I can read Munchlax like a book!",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1800_10": "He’s been my partner for years, and we\ngrew up together, so he’s like a brother\nto me.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_1900_10": "Back in Hisui, he always fought by my side,\nand we never needed a Poké Ball, either.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2000_10": "But...Pasio does have its own rules.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2100_10": "I’ve learned from Adaman and Irida how to\nbecome a sync pair and get Munchlax into\na Poké Ball.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2200_10": "Back in Hisui, I couldn’t really accept the\nGalaxy Expedition Team’s way of using\nPoké Balls...",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2300_10": "But it was nice to see Rei and his Pokémon\nfighting so well together, as if they were\none—like the legendary hero of old.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2400_10": "Now in this era, time has passed, and the\nrelationship between people and Pokémon\nhas changed.",
    "charaepi_ch0311_00_yone/2301_1201_2500_10": "Munchlax and I will strengthen our bond\nby using Poké Balls...",
