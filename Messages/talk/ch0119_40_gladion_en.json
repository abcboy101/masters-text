    "ch0119_40_gladion/7103_0701_03_10": "Might not be bad to take a few academy\nclasses on the latest technology, huh.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/7104_0701_01_10": "I don’t really care about my class ranking at\nschool.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/7104_0701_02_10": "You compete with others to better yourself,\nand all that effort just turns into a number.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/7104_0701_03_10": "If you want to get stronger just to be better\nthan others, you’re doing it for the wrong\nreason.",

    "ch0119_40_gladion/2511_0702_01_10": "You really have to steel yourself when taking\na class on something you’re not good at.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/2511_0702_02_10": "Must be similar to how Pokémon feel when\nbattling at a disadvantage.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/3001_0701_01_10": "Time to get going. Don’t make me wait.",
    "ch0119_40_gladion/3003_0701_01_10": "What are you doing here? Aren’t you going\nto go exploring?",
