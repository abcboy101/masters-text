    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_0200_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Did you come\nhere to train too?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_0300_10": "All right! Then why don’t you train with me for a\nwhile before you go?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_0400_10": "...What’s that? What kind of training am I doing?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_0500_10": "I’ve been smashing boulders, enduring the\npounding rush of the waterfall! Things like that!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_0600_10": "I train like this every day!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0301_0700_10": "To prepare for Pokémon battles?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0401_0800_10": "That’s right! ...Well, to be honest, it’s not JUST\nabout Pokémon battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0302_0900_10": "To get stronger?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0402_1000_10": "I can’t be a very good example for my Pokémon if\nI’m not strong myself, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1100_10": "Strict and consistent training is the secret to my\nstrength!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1200_10": "But recently I’ve been training with a different\ngoal in mind.",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1300_10": "I noticed that my gut’s been looking a little\npudgier lately...",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1400_10": "So I’m working hard to stay fit with my training!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1500_10": "Back in Johto, I was constantly training under the\nwaterfall in the Gym...",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1600_10": "but I’d always follow up training with lots of\nsnacks, so my belly never really changed.",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1700_10": "When I came to Pasio, I thought I’d start fresh!\nI’ve been training more vigorously than ever along\nwith Poliwrath here!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1800_10": "More specifically...we’ve been swimming!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_1900_10": "Swimming is one of Poliwrath’s strengths, so I\nadded it to our training routine.",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2000_10": "Someday we may even be able to swim up the\nwaterfall!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2100_10": "...Wahahah! I guess that may be a little too\nambitious!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2200_10": "But if I keep up this pace, it ought to do more\nthan just tighten up my belly.",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2300_10": "It may also shape my whole body into a great big\nmass of muscle, just like Poliwrath!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2400_10": "Did you know that there’s almost no fat in\nPoliwrath’s body? His whole body is made of\nmuscle!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2500_10": "He’s not just my partner—he’s got the ideal body\ntype that I strive for!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2600_10": "By the way, not to change the subject,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]...",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_2700_10": "but are there any sweets here on Pasio that you’d\nrecommend?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0301_2800_10": "Why do you ask?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0401_2900_10": "Well, I can’t do anything on an empty stomach!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0302_3000_10": "You eat sweets after training?",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_0402_3100_10": "Wahahah! Just a few! That’s all!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_3200_10": "After such rigorous training, I always get the urge\nto eat something sweet! Poliwrath and I have been\nmaking our way through all the shops on Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_3300_10": "There’s nothing better than the taste of sweets to\nsoothe a tired body!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_3400_10": "Depriving yourself of what you love is no good for\nyour body or your mind!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_3500_10": "You just have to make sure to work out as much\nas you eat! Wahahah!",
    "charaepi_ch0171_00_shijima/2301_1201_3600_10": "Like with me! I’ve definitely been training enough\nto balance out what I eat. At least...I thought so?"
