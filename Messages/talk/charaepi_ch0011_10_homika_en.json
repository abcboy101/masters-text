    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_0400_10": "Were you following the sound of Toxtricity’s chest?",
    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_0500_10": "Actually, until just now, I was practicing the bass\nfor the live show with Piers!",
    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_0600_10": "You train with amazing people, right? I was\ngetting passionate, and apparently Toxtricity\nwas as well.",

    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_2700_10": "I guess that’s the result of music allowing us to\ncommunicate without words.",
    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_2800_10": "Music is way more fun together with Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0011_10_homika/2301_1201_2900_10": "As a Gym Leader, I want to tell the world that you\ncan have fun with Pokémon.",
