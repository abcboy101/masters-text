    "episode_event_hisui_02/4003_1001_1400_10": "No...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4003_1001_1500_10": "My memory is faint, but this world still feels a bit\ndifferent.",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_1200_10": "Just as I expected! I’m glad I got to see your\nshocked faces!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_1300_10": "You fool...",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_2000_10": "Cynthia has some interesting stories too. This\nstrong-looking Pokémon is—",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_2500_10": "Absolutely!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_2600_10": "The first time we heard about Giratina, we were\nboth shocked.",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_3400_10": "We wanted to learn more about how people and\nPokémon could coexist...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_3500_10": "so we asked our Pokémon to stay in Poké Balls.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_3600_10": "You use Poké Balls now?!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_3700_10": "Yeah. People and Pokémon in this era work in\nharmony and help each other.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4004_1001_3800_10": "We’ve realized that using Poké Balls isn’t wrong.\nWe can still coexist with Pokémon.",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_2000_10": "A worthy opponent for…Rei?",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_2400_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_2500_10": "I was a mentor to Dawn, and I taught her a lot...",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3200_10": "Yup! That’s the spirit!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3300_10": "Though I don’t think it’s a good idea to let\nPikachu and the others push themselves too hard...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3400_10": "How about this? While your Pokémon get used to\nthis new environment...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3500_10": "Why don’t you try getting to know a new\nPokémon?",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3600_10": "Though there aren’t any wild Pokémon on Pasio...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3700_10": "A new wild Pokémon...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_3800_10": "That’s it! I DO have a new Pokémon! I caught it in\na Pasio Poké Ball!",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4006_1001_4100_10": "Maybe I can form a sync pair with it!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_0100_10": "Fight hard, everyone! Ahh, I wanna battle too!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_0200_10": "I wonder how much everyone has grown as\nsync pairs.",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_0600_10": "Hm? That Pokémon is...!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_0700_10": "Has it ever battled alongside Akari before?",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1300_10": "Since then, they’ve been growing fast as\na sync pair!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1400_10": "It was thanks to Lucas’s help!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1500_10": "Rei... Even in this new land with new friends…",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1600_10": "I’ll still aim to become a worthy opponent for you!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1700_10": "No matter how far ahead you are...I’ll catch up to\nyou, I promise!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1800_10": "Of course! Bring it on!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_1900_10": "Show us how strong you’ve gotten in this new\nland, Akari!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2000_10": "It seems that Akari has changed here on\nPasio, too.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2100_10": "Yeah, we can’t fall behind either.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2200_10": "We’re more experienced than you two when it\ncomes to being a sync pair!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2300_10": "Dawn!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2400_10": "I feel the same way Akari does!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2500_10": "I won’t lose to you...as your mentor!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2600_10": "Good! Just what I wanted!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4007_1001_2700_10": "Let’s not waste any time, and get on\nwith the battle!",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1101_0100_20": "A few days later...",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_0700_10": "It has a similar shine to a sync stone, but...\nLet’s take it back and have a closer look.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_0800_10": "For some reason, Giratina has been interested in\nthis area for a while...",

    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1100_10": "Yes, but these ruins aren’t even real.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1200_10": "They were constructed and designed based on\nruins from different regions, but...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1300_10": "You know, this place looks really similar to ruins I\nsaw in Hisui.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1400_10": "Is something the matter? Now Giratina’s acting up.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1500_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1600_10": "...It’s nothing, sorry.",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1700_10": "Is that so...?",
    "episode_event_hisui_02/4008_1001_1800_10": "(Could it be...?)",
