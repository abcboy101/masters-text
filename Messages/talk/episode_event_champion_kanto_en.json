    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_0500_10": "Knowledge of Pokémon moves and matchups?",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_0600_10": "You’re both half correct!",

    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_0900_10": "I love the warmth you give off, Moltres. You’re the\nabsolute best!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_1000_10": "For starters, you have to get up close to your\nPokémon to understand them!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_1100_10": "Now it’s your turn! Let’s get to know your partner\nPokémon even better!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_1200_10": "By being friends with your partner, you can learn\nthings about them that aren’t in the Pokédex.",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4005_1001_1300_10": "And sometimes that lets you battle in new ways!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4006_1001_0100_10": "Yo, Leaf! Training going all right?",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4006_1001_0200_10": "It’s almost scary how smooth mine is going!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4006_1001_0300_10": "Same here! My teammates are quick learners,\nso they’re doing great!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4006_1001_0400_10": "By the way, I wonder how Red’s doing...",

    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4007_1101_0100_20": "When the two arrived, they saw...",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4007_1001_0200_10": "Ahhhhhh!",
    "episode_event_champion_kanto/4007_1001_0300_10": "We give up! We told you, we surrender!",
