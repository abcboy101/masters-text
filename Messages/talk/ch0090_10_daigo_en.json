    "ch0090_10_daigo/0101_0701_02_10": "Shall we go exploring to satisfy our\ninquisitive minds?",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7101_0701_01_10": "Did you know that Deoxys is the result of the\nsudden mutation of a space virus?",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7101_0701_02_10": "That means that Deoxys originally comes from\nsomewhere in space—far, far beyond the sky we\nsee above us.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7101_0701_03_10": "It’s hard to even imagine things on such an\nenormous scale!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7102_0701_01_10": "The sparkling stars are so romantic—and\ndeeply mysterious.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7102_0701_02_10": "I think that’s why, ever since long ago, people\nhave always been fascinated by outer space.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7102_0701_03_10": "How about you? Are you a fan of outer space?\nIf so, I can show you around the space center in\nMossdeep City.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7103_0701_01_10": "I’ve heard that the crystalline organ on Deoxys’s\nchest is actually its brain.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7103_0701_02_10": "That enchanting sparkle is so beautiful, don’t you\nthink? It’s dangerously alluring.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7103_0701_03_10": "But even a true rock enthusiast like me wouldn’t\ndream of trying to get that crystal for myself!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7104_0701_01_10": "Deoxys is capable of changing into different forms.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7104_0701_02_10": "Its strength lies in being able to adapt to\nits surroundings.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7105_0701_01_10": "In this sygna suit, I match Deoxys’s look!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7105_0701_02_10": "It’s such a sleek and futuristic design.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/7105_0701_03_10": "What do you think, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nI’d like to hear your opinion.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/1701_0701_01_10": "Hey there. Would you please take this?",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/1701_0702_01_10": "It fell suddenly from the sky—a gift from the\nuniverse to you!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/1701_0702_02_10": "*chuckle* Actually, it’s a present from me.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0701_01_10": "Some of the rarest minerals on the planet actually\nexist in abundance out in space.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0701_02_10": "That’s true about a lot of things.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0701_03_10": "It would be so helpful if we could gather some of\nthose minerals from space.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0702_01_10": "Having a bigger source of useful minerals would\nbe a good thing, of course, but...",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0702_02_10": "For a rock maniac like me, it would be sad to see\nthe minerals lose value as they become less\nscarce. It’s a complicated feeling.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2501_0702_03_10": "But minerals have more appeal than just rarity!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2511_0701_01_10": "We humans grow and mature, but we don’t tend\nto change our appearances as drastically as\nPokémon do.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2511_0701_02_10": "Maybe that’s why we learned to enjoy different\nclothes and fashion.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2511_0702_01_10": "Why don’t you try dressing up in some new\nstyles yourself?",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/2511_0702_02_10": "I’d really love to see a totally new look for you!",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/3001_0701_01_10": "Hm... I’ve been lost in thought all morning.\nI don’t suppose it’s a bad thing, though, is it?",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/3003_0701_01_10": "The world is full of mysteries. There’s still much\nfun to be had in chasing them.",
    "ch0090_10_daigo/3005_0701_01_10": "Did you battle with everything you’ve got? And\ndid you think it over after? Good. Then it’s time\nfor a break."
