    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0601_0701_01_10": "In Kalos, when someone does you a kindness, it’s\ncustomary to give them a tip in return.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0601_0701_02_10": "Pasio doesn’t seem to have that custom, so what\ndo you think I should do to show my appreciation?\nWhat would people here want to receive?",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0602_0701_01_10": "I believe the trick to growing stronger is\nenjoying battles.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0602_0701_02_10": "Even if you lose, as long as you enjoyed the battle\nwith your Pokémon, you’ll be ready to give\nit your all next time.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0602_0701_03_10": "If you aren’t having fun, you won’t be in the right\nstate of mind and you could wind up losing your\nnext battle.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0602_0701_04_10": "That’s why I often call battles “play.”",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0603_0701_01_10": "In Sinnoh, there are many myths about the storied\nhistory between people and Pokémon.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0603_0701_02_10": "Pasio is new and artificially created, but someday\nit may also have such stories.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0603_0701_03_10": "A place where history is waiting to be written...\nWhen you think about it like that, it\nsounds marvelous.",

    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0604_0701_02_10": "Of course I enjoyed playing with challengers, and I\ntook pride in what I did.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0604_0701_03_10": "But on Pasio, I can go where I want and play with\nall manner of sync pairs. It is lovely.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0604_0701_04_10": "It reminds me of a time before I joined the Kalos\nElite Four. Adventures are so fun and delightful, no\nmatter what age you are.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/0605_0701_01_10": "The accessories I wear are a traditional design\nwithin my family.",

    "ch0155_00_dracaena/1701_0702_02_10": "You and your partner Pokémon are\nsimply charming!",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2501_0701_01_10": "My partner Pokémon is growing stronger and\nstronger—I think it’s because we’ve been spending\ntime with you. It brings me joy!",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2501_0701_02_10": "You and your Pokémon are so strong. Playing with\nyou is an inspiration. I’m truly grateful.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2501_0702_01_10": "Seeing you and your partner Pokémon grow\nwarms my heart as much as seeing my own\npartner grow.",

    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2511_0701_02_10": "There’s a story that’s passed down in my\ngrandparents’ hometown.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2511_0701_03_10": "The story says that a Pokémon governs time and\nanother Pokémon governs space.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2511_0701_04_10": "It’s a bit of a curious story, but it’s one I believe.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2511_0702_01_10": "If there weren’t Pokémon maintaining time and\nspace, this world may never have come to be.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/2511_0702_02_10": "We may just owe our meeting—and even our\nown existences—to those Pokémon.",
    "ch0155_00_dracaena/3001_0701_01_10": "Oh dear me, you still look quite sleepy. I know...\nPlaying with my Pokémon will wake you right up!",
