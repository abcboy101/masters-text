    "ch0030_40_ran/7101_0701_02_10": "There aren’t a lot of stars near the moon. Maybe\nthey’re shy?",
    "ch0030_40_ran/7102_0701_01_10": "Hehehe... This outfit matches Tate’s!",
    "ch0030_40_ran/7102_0701_02_10": "It’s pretty like the starry sky, isn’t it? So sparkly\nand cute!",

    "ch0030_40_ran/2501_0702_02_10": "If everyone started giving Celesteela their wishes,\nit’d tire Celesteela out!",
    "ch0030_40_ran/2511_0701_01_10": "I wonder if the stars and moon still shine up close.",
    "ch0030_40_ran/2511_0701_02_10": "The other day, I reached my hand toward\nthe stars...",
