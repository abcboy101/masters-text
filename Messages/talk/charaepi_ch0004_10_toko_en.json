    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_0300_10": "All right! That’s our tenth win in a row!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_0400_10": "Oof... I don’t see any way I could’ve won that...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_0500_10": "Thanks for the battle! Let’s do this again sometime!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0301_0600_10": "Looking good!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0401_0700_10": "Not too shabby, if I do say so myself!\nWith Victini as my partner, I feel like I’m\noverflowing with power!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0302_0800_10": "You’re on a roll!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0402_0900_10": "We sure are, but we’re not done yet! Our goal is\nto hit a one-hundred win streak!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_1000_10": "You’re amazing, Hilda! I think you really will get\nto a hundred at this rate!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_1100_10": "Good job to you, too, Victini!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_1200_10": "I guess what people say about Victini is true—that\nit has the power to bring victory!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0301_1300_10": "It brings victory?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0401_1400_10": "People believe it has that power, yeah.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0302_1500_10": "So you can win if you’re with Victini?",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_0402_1600_10": "Yep, that’s what people say!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_1700_10": "Team Plasma once caused a commotion at\nUnova’s Liberty Garden because they were\nafter that power.",

    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_1900_10": "But I wonder if it has some kind of connection to\nthat Victini from Liberty Garden.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2000_10": "Hm... I’m curious, too. Maybe N would be able to\nfigure out more from Victini.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2100_10": "But you know what? Even if Victini does have the\npower to bring victory, Hilda’s strength is the\nreal deal.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2200_10": "Of course I’m strong! Know what my secret is?\nWhen I’m battling, I do my best to enjoy it!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2300_10": "I give it my all and so does Victini!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2400_10": "When we smash all of that together, we combine\nour strength into a single, massive power!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2500_10": "I think once I got the hang of that feeling,\nour win rate really started to rise!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2600_10": "Coming together to create something bigger...\nI guess that’s something you can experience with\nother partner Pokémon, too.",

    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2800_10": "Together, we train, battle, play, sleep, fight...",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_2900_10": "I bet when it comes down to it, the key to winning\nis spending a lot of time with your\npartner Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_3000_10": "Oooh, look! Another sync pair!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_3100_10": "Let’s go, Victini! If we win this next battle, we can\nbump our win streak up to 11!",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_3200_10": "Hilda sure loves to battle.",
    "charaepi_ch0004_10_toko/2301_1201_3300_10": "Victini must think Hilda’s an ideal Trainer.",
