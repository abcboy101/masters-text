    "episode_event_specialcos03/4008_1001_0400_10": "Of all people, why him?",
    "episode_event_specialcos03/4008_1001_0500_10": "He has no sense of direction whatsoever. How will\nwe even find them?!",
    "episode_event_specialcos03/4008_1001_0600_10": "Y’know, it might be fun since he could take them\nto all kinds of places.",
    "episode_event_specialcos03/4008_1001_0700_10": "That’s not the point!",
    "episode_event_specialcos03/4008_1001_0800_10": "Hey, are you guys referring to the Champion Leon?",

    "episode_event_specialcos03/4009_1001_1400_10": "We may have run into a few hiccups, but we’re\nall settled now!",
