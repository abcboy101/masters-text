    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0300_10": "Hoho! I guess I never told you two before.",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0400_10": "When I was young, I was a serious\nPokémon Trainer!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0500_10": "A serious Trainer, huh...",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0600_10": "I wonder what it would’ve been like to know you\nback then...",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0700_10": "That old duff was tough and handsome.",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_0800_10": "But that was decades ago. He’s a shadow of his\nformer self now.",

    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_1200_10": "As rivals, we used to battle each other a lot to\nsee which one of us was stronger.",

    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_1500_10": "So that’s why you’re so good at battling with\nNidorino—it’s because you’ve trained a lot over\nthe years!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_1600_10": "I was surprised, because Nidorino can’t use as\nmany moves as Nidoking.",

    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2100_10": "Why haven’t you evolved your Nidorino,\nProfessor Oak?",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2200_10": "Well...",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2300_10": "The main reason is for Pokémon research!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2400_10": "It goes without saying that Nidorino and Nidoking\nare different Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2500_10": "As a researcher, I need to know the strengths and\nbest ways of battling with Nidorino...",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2600_10": "AND the best ways of battling with Nidoking!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2700_10": "So, I’m now researching what’s great about\nNidorino by being partners with him.",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2800_10": "Cool!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_2900_10": "That’s amazing, Professor Oak!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_3000_10": "Another reason is...",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_3100_10": "Actually...never mind!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_3200_10": "We should also get stronger by finding our\npartners’ unique strength!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_3300_10": "Yeah!",
    "episode_event_ch0137_orchid/4001_1001_3400_10": "Well, well... I guess you both decided to take it\neasy like that old duff. Best of luck to you anyway."
