    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4003_1001_2000_10": "Oh no! How could this happen?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4003_1001_2100_10": "We both came to a mutual understanding as\nfellow entertainers, but Blacephalon lost its way\nback home...",

    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_0600_10": "That Drampa must really like being\naround children...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_0700_10": "And it looks like she’s been protecting the children\nfrom the dangers of the mountain.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_0800_10": "She’s a kind Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_0900_10": "Come on... Drampa...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_1000_10": "I know you want to play games with children, but\nwe need to get going...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_1100_10": "Ahaha! What a pathetic Trainer!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_1200_10": "You can’t let a Pokémon control you like that...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4004_1001_1300_10": "That’s why dragon masters aren’t beautiful!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4005_1001_0100_10": "Excuse me?! Who the heck are you?",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4005_1001_0200_10": "I’m Katherine! A Gym Trainer in Laverre City—and\na furisode girl, too!",

    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_1500_10": "thanks for believing in me.",

    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2000_10": "So, I’m better than you because I didn’t cheat—I\nclimbed the mountain with my own feet!",

    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2400_10": "Ugh! It was stupid of me to give you ANY credit\nfor this!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2500_10": "Let’s settle once and for all who’s better!",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2600_10": "You’re on! I’ll never EVER lose to a dragon master.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2700_10": "There they go again...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2800_10": "*sigh* They’ve still got a lot to learn...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_2900_10": "They’re both similar to each other. Maybe neither\none of them wants to give in.",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_3000_10": "But such relationships can also shine beautifully...",
    "episode_event_newyear_2024/4009_1001_3100_10": "Don’t you agree, Blacephalon?"
