    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0300_10": "I was just thinking about its depths while\nlooking at the water with Lugia.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0400_10": "We awakened our arc suit, which is proof of\nour strong bond.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0500_10": "I was thinking about Lugia and all we’ve\nbeen through.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0600_10": "Sometimes, it still feels unreal that I’m its\npartner.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0700_10": "I may have mentioned this before, but\nLugia’s powers are too strong, so it tries\nto distance itself from people.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0800_10": "They say that’s why Lugia chooses to live\ndeep under the sea.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_0900_10": "Did you know that about Lugia?",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1000_10": "In Johto, we have the Whirl Islands. They\nused to all be one large island, but they\nwere split into four.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1100_10": "Two countries were fighting over\nthe island back then.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1200_10": "They say Lugia got upset and cast lightning\nbolts to tear the island into four pieces.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1300_10": "And ever since, Lugia’s supposedly been\nhiding at the bottom of the sea.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1400_10": "If what they say is true, why’d Lugia make\nits way back to land?",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0301_1500_10": "To team up with you, Ethan?",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0401_1600_10": "Heheh! Wouldn’t that be nice!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0302_1700_10": "To keep people from fighting?",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0402_1800_10": "Maybe! Lugia IS kind, you know!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_1900_10": "I suppose it doesn’t matter why.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2000_10": "What’s important now is that Lugia\nacknowledges me—and that I obtained an\narc suit!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2100_10": "That must mean our strong bond was\nrecognized!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2200_10": "I’ve gotta keep aiming higher—for Lugia and\nmyself!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2300_10": "Lugia! Let’s do our best!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2400_10": "... ... ...",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0301_2500_10": "Lugia?",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0401_2600_10": "Haha! Lugia’s always like this.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0302_2700_10": "So stoic!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_0402_2800_10": "Right? That’s what makes Lugia so cool!",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_2900_10": "But I can tell...",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_3000_10": "Lugia acts cool on the outside, but it feels\nthe same way I do.",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_3100_10": "How can I tell? Well...",
    "charaepi_ch0112_90_hibiki/2301_1201_3200_10": "This arc suit should be proof enough!"
