    "charaepi_ch0155_00_dracaena/2301_1201_0400_10": "You need to properly greet them first, like in a\nPokémon battle.",

    "charaepi_ch0155_00_dracaena/2301_0401_1000_10": "Right? What’s more, watching Dragalge float\nmerrily along in the ocean is so charming!",

    "charaepi_ch0155_00_dracaena/2301_0402_2300_10": "Because you and your Pokémon are simply\ncharming!",
    "charaepi_ch0155_00_dracaena/2301_1201_2400_10": "If you want your partner Pokémon to grow\nstronger, you need a rival, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0155_00_dracaena/2301_1201_2500_10": "Being on the same team and helping each other\nis important, too, but I want someone who can\nchallenge us and push us to our limits.",
