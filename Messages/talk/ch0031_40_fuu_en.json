    "ch0031_40_fuu/0101_0701_02_10": "I can see a future where we enjoy the star\nfestival together!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7101_0701_01_10": "When you look up at the night sky, it’s full of stars,\nand it carries on forever... Really makes you think\nabout how wide space is.",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7101_0701_02_10": "I wonder if people or Pokémon live somewhere on\nthose stars!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7101_0701_03_10": "It would be great if we could adventure in space\nfreely one day!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7102_0701_01_10": "Apparently the star festival is where you wish\nupon a star and have fun with everyone.",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7102_0701_02_10": "I wonder why they started to host festivals to wish\non stars.",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7102_0701_03_10": "Maybe people a long time ago met Jirachi and\ncame up with the idea!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7103_0701_01_10": "They say Jirachi can make any wish come true!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7103_0701_02_10": "I can imagine that if I wished to win a Pokémon\nbattle, Jirachi could make it come true, but...",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7103_0701_03_10": "with Jirachi, I can win any battle without making\na wish!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7104_0701_01_10": "Hehehe... This outfit matches Liza’s!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7104_0701_02_10": "We’re both shiny, just like the stars!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7104_0701_03_10": "It’s the perfect outfit to enjoy the star festival!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7105_0701_01_10": "I wanna be friends with you forever,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7105_0701_02_10": "That’s my wish, but I don’t want to rely on\nJirachi’s power.",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/7105_0701_03_10": "I hope I can make my wish come true on my own!",

    "ch0031_40_fuu/2501_0701_02_10": "Huh? Do I know when Jirachi will wake up next?",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2501_0701_03_10": "Whaaa?! A th-thousand years? It’s going to sleep\nfor that long?!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2501_0702_01_10": "If I slept for a thousand years, I think I could stay\nawake for a thousand years, too...",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2501_0702_02_10": "and I guess I wouldn’t get in trouble for staying\nup late?",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2511_0701_01_10": "Stars are constantly moving, and apparently there\nare these two stars that meet only once per year.",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2511_0701_02_10": "That must be lonely for them...",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2511_0701_03_10": "It made me realize how special it is that I can see\nyou or Liza whenever I want!",
    "ch0031_40_fuu/2511_0702_01_10": "Even if you or Liza were to go somewhere\nfar away...",
