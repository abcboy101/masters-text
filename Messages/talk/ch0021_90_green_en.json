    "ch0021_90_green/0101_0701_02_10": "You’ve kept me waiting long enough. C’mon, let’s\nget going!",
    "ch0021_90_green/7101_0701_01_10": "Now that I’m a Neo Champion, I’m gonna kick up\na HUGE storm!",
    "ch0021_90_green/7101_0701_02_10": "Better watch out! Don’t get too scared when we\ncome at you with our roaring thunder!",
    "ch0021_90_green/7102_0701_01_10": "Once the Kanto power plant was down...",
    "ch0021_90_green/7102_0701_02_10": "It was a real pain in the neck. I couldn’t listen to\nthe radio or ride the magnet train in Saffron City!",
    "ch0021_90_green/7103_0701_01_10": "You might already know this, but Red, Leaf, and I\nall left Pallet Town to start our journeys at the\nsame time.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7103_0701_02_10": "Even if our start was the same, we all took\ndifferent paths.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7103_0701_03_10": "You can tell from our battle styles. The Pokémon,\nmoves, and tactics we use are all different.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7103_0701_04_10": "It’s interesting how you can see a Trainer’s life\nin the way they battle.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7104_0701_01_10": "Whoa, careful. Don’t get too close to me\nright now.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7104_0701_02_10": "I was just petting Zapdos, so I’ve got a lot of\nbuilt-up static electricity. If you get too close,\nyou might get shocked!",
    "ch0021_90_green/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. What do you\nthink of my outfit?",
    "ch0021_90_green/7105_0701_02_10": "Personally, I think it’s pretty awesome.",
    "ch0021_90_green/7105_0701_03_10": "It’s perfect for me and Zapdos!",
    "ch0021_90_green/1701_0701_01_10": "Take this, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0021_90_green/1701_0702_01_10": "Find a use for it and get stronger!",
    "ch0021_90_green/1701_0702_02_10": "It’s no fun for me if you’re weak!",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0701_01_10": "I got really excited when I caught Zapdos...",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0701_02_10": "So the first thing I did after that was find Red and\nLeaf so I could brag!",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0701_03_10": "But when I did, I saw...",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0701_04_10": "they’d also caught Articuno and Moltres!",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0702_01_10": "I guess we were all thinking the same thing.",
    "ch0021_90_green/2501_0702_02_10": "But...if they couldn’t at least do that, it wouldn’t\nbe worth being rivals with them!",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0701_01_10": "When I wear this outfit, it reminds me of when I\nbecame the Champion of Kanto.",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0701_02_10": "At the time, I really thought I was the strongest\nin the world.",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0701_03_10": "Now that I’ve come to Pasio and seen how big the\nworld really is, I kinda laugh at my past self.",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0702_01_10": "But...I’ve changed since then, y’know.",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0702_02_10": "I’ve got the perfect combinations to use with the\nperfect partner! And more importantly...",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0702_03_10": "my trust in my Pokémon is top-notch!",
    "ch0021_90_green/2511_0702_04_10": "Hah, maybe I really am the world’s strongest!",
    "ch0021_90_green/3001_0701_01_10": "Bonjour! If you keep snoozing, I’m gonna leave\nyou behind.",
    "ch0021_90_green/3003_0701_01_10": "Yo! I was getting kinda bored, and now I’m\nitching for some competition! Wanna battle me?",
    "ch0021_90_green/3005_0701_01_10": "I start to think about a lot of stuff at night... Like\nPokémon and what’ll happen in the future..."
