    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7101_0701_01_10": "There’s an ancient painted image on\nRunerigus’s body.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7101_0701_02_10": "And apparently, horrific memories are associated\nwith that image...",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7101_0701_03_10": "What’s carved into stone doesn’t disappear\neasily, so the message within the image engraved\non Runerigus must be important.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7102_0701_01_10": "The point of wearing a costume is to look like\nsomeone else...",

    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7102_0701_03_10": "I’ll turn you to stone and add you to my collection!",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7102_0701_04_10": "...How was I?",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7103_0701_01_10": "At the Rustboro Gym, we have minerals and fossils\non display, just like a museum.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7103_0701_02_10": "Of course, collecting stones is my hobby, but...",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7103_0701_03_10": "I want the students of the Trainers’ School to learn\nsomething there, too.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7104_0701_01_10": "When you actually take to time to examine things\nand feel them with your own hands, you can learn\nmore about them.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7104_0701_02_10": "And places like museums give you that\nopportunity. That’s why we must cherish them.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/7105_0701_01_10": "I’ll be meeting my rock pals soon to talk about the\nrare stones we’ve found.",

    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0701_01_10": "Stones have the potential to last forever, so they\ncan contain all kinds of thoughts.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0701_02_10": "A stone can get passed on to different people and\nPokémon, all of their feelings accumulating...",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0701_03_10": "So even an ordinary-looking stone can carry a\nstupendous story!",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0702_01_10": "A stone can store both good thoughts and bad.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0702_02_10": "I’ve been told voices can be heard from stones\nthat store a ghost Pokémon’s grudge...",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2501_0702_03_10": "Ehehe! Even stones with a peculiar charm can be\nmesmerizing!",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2511_0701_01_10": "Pewter Crunchies—a Pewter City specialty—are a\nsnack that look just like stones!",

    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2511_0702_01_10": "But Pewter Crunchies can be as hard as Brock’s\nGeodude, so...",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/2511_0702_02_10": "If you don’t have the jaw of a Tyrantrum, you\nwon’t be able to eat much.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/3001_0701_01_10": "*yawn* I got too worked up yesterday. How silly\nof me.",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/3003_0701_01_10": "Have you finished preparing for the festival?\nEveryone is wearing such extraordinary costumes,\ndon’t you think?",
    "ch0044_40_tsutsuji/3005_0701_01_10": "Let’s enjoy ourselves tonight! Though we shouldn’t\nstay up too late, OK?"
