    "episode_event_winter_2024/4001_1001_1100_10": "Why don’t we put on a show at the winter party\nwith some music?",

    "episode_event_winter_2024/4002_1001_1900_10": "Yeah, we know some sync pairs who share\nyour spirit!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4002_1001_2000_10": "Really?! Yes, please!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4002_1001_2100_10": "Got it. We’ll get rollin’ on that.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4002_1001_2200_10": "And as for your performance...we’re lookin’\nforward to it.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0100_10": "Piers told us you were looking for people to join\nyour musical ensemble!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0200_10": "I’d love to! Please let me join!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0300_10": "Yeah, let’s make some amazing music together!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0400_10": "Of course! It’ll be great to have you!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0500_10": "So you’re the ones who share our “spirit,” huh?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0600_10": "This should be plenty of people for our ensemble!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0700_10": "So let’s get right down to practi—",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0800_10": "Huh? What’s that sound?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_0900_10": "A Pokémon cry? Or was it an instrument?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4003_1001_1000_10": "Where’s it coming from?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4004_1001_0100_10": "The melody was coming from over here.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4004_1001_0200_10": "Oh! Look!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4004_1001_0300_10": "Great job, Kricketune! Just like that!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4004_1001_0400_10": "Now let’s try something more playful.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4004_1001_0500_10": "So it was Kricketune making that lovely melody!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0100_10": "That was fantastic! Just like a Vespiquen\ncontrolling her Combee!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0200_10": "Kricketune is adjusting his melody based on your\nmovements. It’s clear you trust each other, or you\nwouldn’t be able to pull that off!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0300_10": "Heh heh. Thanks!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0400_10": "Isn’t that nice to hear, Kricketune?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0500_10": "So it was Kricketune making that lovely sound!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0600_10": "That was a wonderful performance!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0700_10": "Lillie? And all the rest of you, too. What are you\ndoing here?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0800_10": "Actually, Bugsy...would you be our conductor?!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_0900_10": "Huh? Me? A conductor?! What’s this about, all of\na sudden.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1000_10": "We’re putting together a music group to perform\nat the winter party.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1100_10": "And when I heard you and Kricketune performing\njust now, I had to ask!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1200_10": "Huh, sounds fun!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1300_10": "B-but we were just playing around. We’re not\nexperts or anything.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1400_10": "No need to be shy!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1500_10": "This is an opportunity to show everyone how great\nKricketune is!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1600_10": "Besides, they approached you just to say how\nmuch they enjoyed your and Kricketune’s\nperformance. Right?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1700_10": "Won’t you? Please?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1800_10": "...OK!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_1900_10": "I’m not sure how well I’ll do, but I’ll be your\nconductor!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4005_1001_2000_10": "Thank you!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1101_0100_20": "With the help of Bugsy’s conducting, Lillie and the\nothers began practicing for their performance.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0200_10": "Our harmonies are really coming together thanks\nto your conducting, Bugsy!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0300_10": "That’s right! And it seems Primarina and the others\nfind our music easy to sing along to!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0400_10": "Our conductor sure looks the part, too!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0500_10": "At this rate, I’m sure our performance will—",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0600_10": "That was amazing, Kricketune!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0700_10": "Your melody was completely different from when\nyou were performing alone.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0800_10": "Let’s practice once more! From the top!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_0900_10": "Oh, I get it! You’re changing your melody to match\nthe sounds around you!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1000_10": "Um...Bugsy? Would you mind conducting for us,\nplease?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1100_10": "Oh, sorry! I was so wrapped up in what\nKricketune was doing.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1200_10": "Well then, let’s try again.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1101_1300_20": "They continued to rehearse for a bit, but...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1400_10": "(Ohh! The melody changed again!)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1500_10": "(Kricketune sure plays a lot of different melodies\nfor me.)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1600_10": "(If we grow even closer, I bet I’ll hear\neven more—)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1700_10": "Bugsyyy! You stopped conducting!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1800_10": "Oh... Sorry!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_1900_10": "I got totally absorbed listening to Kricketune’s\nplaying...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2000_10": "Hee hee! You really love Kricketune, don’t you,\nBugsy.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2100_10": "Yeah, you’ve been watching Kricketune the whole\ntime we’ve been practicing!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2200_10": "Why don’t we take a break?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2300_10": "Yeah, we’ll tire ourselves out if we keep\npracticing forever.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2400_10": "Great work so far, Primarina.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2500_10": "(The rehearsal’s come to a standstill because\nof me.)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2600_10": "(At this rate, I’ll be no good as a conductor.)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2700_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4006_1001_2800_10": "Bugsy?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0100_10": "Kricketune...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0200_10": "This isn’t working, is it.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0300_10": "What’s wrong, Bugsy?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0400_10": "Things not going as planned?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0500_10": "Aaron, Lillie...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0600_10": "Was there a problem with our performance?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0700_10": "No, not at all. You’ve done nothing wrong.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0800_10": "I’m actually worried about how I act around\nKricketune.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_0900_10": "What? But you get along so well!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1000_10": "That’s the problem.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1100_10": "I love Kricketune SO much!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1200_10": "Ummm...?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1300_10": "What’s wrong with that?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1400_10": "I love Kricketune so much, I keep getting\ndistracted by him.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1500_10": "That’s why the rehearsal ground to a halt earlier.\nI keep causing problems for everyone.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1600_10": "Problems?! No!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1700_10": "And it wouldn’t be good for Kricketune if I spoiled\nhim too much.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1800_10": "I think I should put some distance between us,\nbefore I end up hurting Kricketune.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_1900_10": "Bugsy...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2000_10": "This is just my opinion, but I think things are\njust fine.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2100_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2200_10": "It’s kind of you to think of what’s best for\nKricketune.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2300_10": "But as long as you can spend time with him and\nspoil him, you should!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2400_10": "At least, that’s what I think!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2500_10": "Lillie...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2600_10": "Besides, Pokémon are stronger than we give them\ncredit for!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2700_10": "I agree with Lillie!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2800_10": "If you really love your Pokémon, then show it!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_2900_10": "No need to suppress that affection!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_3000_10": "You...really think so?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_3100_10": "Thanks, both of you. That’s a relief to hear.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_3200_10": "To tell you the truth, I want to become even closer\nfriends with Kricketune!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_3300_10": "Lillie! Bugsy! Come on—let’s practice!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4007_1001_3400_10": "Let’s put all that aside for now...and concentrate\non this rehearsal!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0100_10": "Sorry I kept you all waiting!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1101_0200_20": "And so Bugsy and the others resumed their\npractice.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0300_10": "Bugsy!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0400_10": "Think about how best to draw out Kricketune’s\nstrengths!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0500_10": "(How to draw out his... Oh, I know!)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0600_10": "(Kricketune changes his melody based on others’\nmusic around him!)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0700_10": "(What if I got everyone to sing even better?\nBut how can I do that?)",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0800_10": "Hey, you two Primarina! Try singing with fuller\nvoices! Imagine you’re puffed up like a balloon!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_0900_10": "Yeah, that sounds great!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1101_1000_20": "And then...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_1100_10": "Thanks, everyone!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_1200_10": "Practicing over and over like that really helped us\npull this together!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4008_1001_1300_10": "Yeah! Let’s go all out at the real performance, too!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0100_10": "Deep breaths...",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0200_10": "Nervous?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0300_10": "A little... What about you, Lillie?",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0400_10": "Me too. Just a bit.",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0500_10": "But more so, I’m excited!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0600_10": "Yeah, same!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0700_10": "Let’s put on the best performance we can!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0800_10": "Yes! And as conductor, I’ll lead everyone!",
    "episode_event_winter_2024/4009_1001_0900_10": "OK, let’s go! We’re gonna give the gift of music!",
