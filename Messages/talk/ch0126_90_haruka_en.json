    "ch0126_90_haruka/7103_0701_03_10": "I might even be able to unleash more power!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/7104_0701_01_10": "I can’t believe I’m a Neo Champion. It feels like\na dream!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/7104_0701_02_10": "It’s honestly so moving...",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/7104_0701_03_10": "But I won’t let myself be satisfied! I’m gonna get\neven stronger!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/7105_0701_01_10": "I was able to become a Neo Champion thanks to\neveryone I’ve met so far!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/7105_0701_02_10": "Like my dad, Brendan, Steven...and everyone\nelse, too.",

    "ch0126_90_haruka/2501_0702_01_10": "We’ve had our ups and downs with Team Aqua...\nBut now I’m truly cheering for them!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2501_0702_02_10": "They may have gone too far before, but I\nunderstand wanting to create a better world!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2501_0702_03_10": "And if there’s anything Kyogre and I can do,\nwe plan to help!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0701_01_10": "To be honest, until recently, it felt as if Brendan\nhad gotten out of reach.",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0701_02_10": "We shared the same starting point, but I felt\nleft behind.",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0701_03_10": "But now that I’m a Neo Champion, I feel like I’ve\ncaught up!",

    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0702_01_10": "If I take it too easy, Brendan’ll leave me in the\ndust again!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0702_02_10": "This time, I’ll take the lead! And I want you to\nhelp me!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/2511_0702_03_10": "Let’s train in secret to get even better than\nBrendan!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/3001_0701_01_10": "Waking up early is great because it means more\ntime for playing with Pokémon!",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/3003_0701_01_10": "I can’t believe it’s already lunchtime! Guess I lost \ntrack of time. Wanna take a little break together?",
    "ch0126_90_haruka/3005_0701_01_10": "There’s something about gazing into the night sky\nthat just takes your breath away..."
