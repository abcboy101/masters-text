    "episode_event_summer_2025/4007_1001_1800_10": "You’re an expert on archeology and\nPokémon battles, right?",
    "episode_event_summer_2025/4007_1001_1900_10": "So you’re pretty much a pro. You ever feel\ndown when you fail?",
    "episode_event_summer_2025/4007_1001_2000_10": "Hmm... Can’t say I don’t.",
    "episode_event_summer_2025/4007_1001_2100_10": "But I got this far because of my passion for\nthose things.",
