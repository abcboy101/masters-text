    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_0300_10": "Of course! This is MY collection, after all.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_0600_10": "Of course not! I’m the director of a museum,\nafter all. Leave management to me!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_1100_10": "A security guard actually heard the crying, so\nperhaps there’s an object among the exhibits\nthat’s haunted...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_1400_10": "So, I want the two of you to help me identify\nwhat’s causing this strange phenomenon.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_1500_10": "Understood! We’ll figure out what’s going on!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4001_1001_1600_10": "Sure, I’ll help as well. I’d feel sorry for the exhibits\nif they were just put away without anyone\nenjoying them.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/6801_1001_0100_10": "We must explain the sounds of sobbing heard in\nthe museum at night...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/6801_1001_0200_10": "A lost visitor? No, no, that’s not possible...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/6801_1001_0300_10": "Ahahaha! You could actually be right?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/6801_1001_0400_10": "After all, it’s not just people that get lost!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1101_0100_20": "Roxanne and Lenora waited until nightfall and met\njust before the strange phenomenon was rumored\nto occur. And then...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_0200_10": "Good evening, Roxanne!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_0300_10": "Phoebe? What brings you here?",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_0500_10": "Recently, I’ve been getting this feeling that\nsomeone’s calling out to me.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_0800_10": "Maybe that feeling you had is connected to our\nstrange phenomenon somehow.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_0900_10": "“Strange phenomenon”?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1000_10": "Yes, you see...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1100_10": "The sound of sobbing, huh...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1200_10": "Ahaha! Then we better get going and check inside!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1300_10": "It’s great to have a Ghost-type expert helping us!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1400_10": "I’m getting excited, too!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1500_10": "Y-you both have nerves of steel...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4002_1001_1600_10": "Anyway, if Phoebe is with us, I’ll feel safe no\nmatter what we encounter!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0100_10": "That’s strange... There shouldn’t be anyone here\nright now, but the lights are on.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0200_10": "It feels a little chilly around my feet...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0400_10": "Wait, is that an Icy Rock?!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0500_10": "It’s a stone you give to Pokémon, right?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0600_10": "Exactly. You’d usually give it to Pokémon that can\nmake it snow.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0700_10": "You’d give a Heat Rock to Pokémon that control\nsunlight, and a Damp Rock to Pokémon that\ncontrol rain.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0800_10": "Ahahaha! You know a lot, Roxanne!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_0900_10": "But I wonder why there’s one on the floor.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1000_10": "Maybe someone touched the display?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1100_10": "Do you think there’s...a thief?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1200_10": "Then again, none of our exhibits have been stolen,\nso probably not.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1600_10": "Just as I thought! It’s coming from over there!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1700_10": "Whoa! R-really?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4003_1001_1800_10": "I don’t think we’re imagining things.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0100_10": "*sniffle* *sob*",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0200_10": "Erm... Ah, look! There she is!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0500_10": "What’s the matter, little one? Come now, you can\ntell us.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0600_10": "I was playing hide-and-seek, but this place is big\nand I got lost...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0700_10": "Oh dear...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0800_10": "You’re safe now. Well done for being so brave.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_0900_10": "So there was nothing scary happening here\nafter all.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1000_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1100_10": "Now then, let’s take her outside.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1200_10": "Wait... My friends are still inside.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1300_10": "Please help them too!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1400_10": "OK, let’s go find them!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1500_10": "Do you have any idea where they might be?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1600_10": "No, I don’t...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1700_10": "I see... Well, come with us for now so you don’t\nget lost again!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1800_10": "OK!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4004_1001_1900_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0100_10": "This exhibition area has geological formations and\nrock excavations from various regions!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0400_10": "Oh, and this is a geological sample collected from\nMt. Moon in Kanto!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0500_10": "There are many old strata in that area—you\ncan even find Pokémon fossils!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0600_10": "Wow! You know a lot about stones!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0700_10": "I do! I have an acquaintance who is a rock\nmaniac, but I’m no different!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0800_10": "Wow...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_0900_10": "Then what about these? They look like a coffin\nand a slab. I guess they don’t have any\nassociation with geology...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_1000_10": "Hmm?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_1100_10": "Maybe they’re from an ancient excavation?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_1200_10": "Eeeek!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4005_1001_1300_10": "Th-they moved?! Maybe there really was a\nhaunted—",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_0300_10": "Maybe these wild Pokémon got mixed up with the\nobjects we’re putting on display and brought here\nby accident.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_0400_10": "Yikes... If we battle here, our exhibits might get\ndamaged. We probably should escape for now...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_1200_10": "See? Both of them look happy! They’re excited to\nsee her again!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_1300_10": "These two are really nice Pokémon! They play\ngames with me!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_1400_10": "So, are they your Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_1500_10": "No, but...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_2500_10": "Her body looks like clay, or even stone. That’s a\nvery unusual composition!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_2600_10": "Sure! I think we’ll get along!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_2700_10": "Ahahaha! Of course you’d notice that, Roxanne!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4006_1001_2800_10": "Anyway, case closed! Let’s all go home now!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4007_1001_0300_10": "Yeah! All these great things happened, and we\neven made new friends!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4007_1001_0500_10": "I know! Could you tell us what kind of games\nyou played with Runerigus—",
    "episode_event_halloween_2023/4007_1001_0600_10": "Oh? Where did that girl go?",
