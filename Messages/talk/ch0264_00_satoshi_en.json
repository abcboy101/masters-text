    "ch0264_00_satoshi/0101_0701_02_10": "I hope you’re ready for plenty of battles\nwith me today!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7101_0701_01_10": "The most important thing about battling is\nunderstanding your Pokémon... And, of course,\nguts and enthusiasm!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7101_0701_02_10": "If you meet your opponent with a fired-up\nattitude, you’re sure to have a great battle!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7102_0701_01_10": "You know, the more important it is that I wake up\non time, the more likely I am to oversleep.",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7102_0701_02_10": "I swear I do remember to set an alarm!\nBut for some reason, it’s always broken\nwhen I wake up...",

    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7103_0701_02_10": "but you can’t forget the food!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7103_0701_03_10": "After all, if you’re too hungry, you can’t \nconcentrate on the battles!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7104_0701_01_10": "I’ve had lots of friends travel with me up\nuntil now—but for every new meeting,\nthere’s also a good-bye!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7104_0701_02_10": "Even the people who aren’t with me now are all\ndoing their best somewhere.",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7104_0701_03_10": "So it makes me really happy when I get to see\nthem sometimes!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7105_0701_01_10": "My rival here on Pasio\nis...[Name:PlayerNickname ]! I choose you!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7105_0701_02_10": "Hahaha! But I’m serious about the rival part!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/7105_0701_03_10": "If we keep on challenging each other, determined\nnot to lose, there’s no limit to how strong\nwe’ll get!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! Here, this is for you!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/1701_0702_01_10": "Using items effectively is just the first step toward\nbecoming a Pokémon Master!",

    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0701_02_10": "It was kinda rough when we first met. He used to\nzap me with electricity all the time!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0701_03_10": "But I really wanted to grow closer with him, so I\njust kept meeting him head on until we grew to\nunderstand each other.",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0701_04_10": "A lot has happened since then, but now\nhe’s my best friend and partner!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0702_01_10": "So, I heard that here on Pasio, they call the\ncombination of Trainer and Pokémon a “sync pair.”",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0702_02_10": "Well, I’m confident that I’m more in sync with\nPikachu than anyone else is with their Pokémon!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2501_0702_03_10": "Just watch—we’ll become the best sync pair\non Pasio!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2511_0701_01_10": "The day Pikachu and I left Pallet Town to\nstart our travels together...",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2511_0701_02_10": "we saw a huge Pokémon flying across a rainbow\nin the sky.",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2511_0701_03_10": "I thought maybe if we kept traveling long enough,\nwe could meet a Pokémon like that! Seriously, that\nwas so exciting!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2511_0702_01_10": "And now we’ve traveled all over the place and\nmet a whole ton of totally incredible Pokémon!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/2511_0702_02_10": "Someday I’ll tell you all about every Pokémon that\nPikachu and I have befriended!",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! I’m glad I actually woke up on\ntime today! I oversleep a lot...",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/3003_0701_01_10": "Man, that smells good... My stomach’s growling\nlike crazy! Wanna go get some lunch?",
    "ch0264_00_satoshi/3005_0701_01_10": "It sure got dark fast, huh. I hope I get to battle\nsome awesome sync pairs tomorrow!"
