    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5100_10": "Listen to what I’m saying! My answer is no!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5200_10": "Besides, I have yet to deem you worthy of the\ntitle of Champion—",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5300_10": "I’m not gonna fold until you say yes! I want you to\nteam up with me!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5400_10": "What a hassle... Fine, then! I guess I have\nno choice.",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5500_10": "Yay! That’s what I’m talking about!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4002_1001_5600_10": "Let’s do this, Bede!",

    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_0400_10": "Yeah! Battling’s the best way to get to know each\nother, right?",

    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_2300_10": "I feel like I can do it!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_2400_10": "Great! Now let’s all battle together!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_2500_10": "Oh, I forgot! Hey, Hilda!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_2600_10": "Please—team up with me!",

    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_3600_10": "Right? Makes you want to battle even more!",
    "episode_event_sv_nemo/4003_1001_3700_10": "Let’s go battle more teams!",
