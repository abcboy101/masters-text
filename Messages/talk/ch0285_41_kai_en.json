    "ch0285_41_kai/0101_0701_01_10": "Hi, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! If you’re\nheading out today, mind if I come too?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/0101_0701_02_10": "I’m really looking forward to exploring\nthis great wide world with you!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7101_0701_01_10": "You want to know what caution and\nforesight mean?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7101_0701_02_10": "They mean thinking carefully about what\nlies ahead!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7101_0701_03_10": "Can’t say I’ve been doing much of that\nsince I came to Pasio, though.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7102_0701_01_10": "Pasio is so well lit, even at night.\nIt feels safe.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7102_0701_02_10": "Back in Hisui, I had to use torches,\nbut they weren’t nearly as bright as this.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7102_0701_03_10": "And most importantly, it’s not hot!\nBeing around open flames is so\nuncomfortable.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7103_0701_01_10": "Terastallizing can actually change your\nPokémon’s type.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7103_0701_02_10": "That means even when you think you\nhave the upper hand, it can slip away—\nand the reverse can happen too.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7103_0701_03_10": "It opens up a whole new range of\nstrategies. Terastallizing could make\nbattles even more exciting!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7104_0701_01_10": "I’ve been practicing my flute for the\nupcoming festival.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7104_0701_02_10": "I hope I can create a space where\neveryone can enjoy it!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nLet’s take a picture together later!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7105_0701_02_10": "Wearing this new outfit, I feel like I have\nto capture this moment—not just let it\nbecome a memory.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/7105_0701_03_10": "Plus, I’m curious to see what side of you\nthe picture brings out!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/1701_0701_01_10": "There you are! Here, this is for you.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/1701_0702_01_10": "I’m so grateful for everything you do.\nLet’s keep giving it our best!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2501_0701_01_10": "Every day since I arrived on Pasio,\nI’ve been thinking about how vast the\nworld truly is.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2501_0701_02_10": "From Paldea’s Terastallizing to Galar’s\nDynamaxing...",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2501_0701_03_10": "there must be so much more out there\nto discover!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2501_0702_01_10": "I want to see everything in this great\nwide world someday!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2501_0702_02_10": "But to do that, I need to get stronger\nwith my Pokémon!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0701_01_10": "Gloria let me try this dish called “curry,”\nand it was really good. Even Typhlosion\nseemed to like it!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0701_02_10": "I also had something called a “sandwich”\nfrom a friend from Paldea. That was\ntasty, too!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0701_03_10": "The world really is full of delicious food,\nisn’t it?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0702_01_10": "Everyone’s been so kind to me. I want to\nfind a way to return the favor.",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0702_02_10": "When it comes to Hisuian food, potato\nmochi’s probably the most well-known,\nright?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/2511_0702_03_10": "Would you mind being my taste tester?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! I was so excited about\ntoday’s festivities that I woke up a\nlittle early!",
    "ch0285_41_kai/3003_0701_01_10": "It’s pretty hot right now, isn’t it? Do you\nknow any spots where we could enjoy a\nbrisk breeze?",
    "ch0285_41_kai/3005_0701_01_10": "Space exists just beyond the sky, right?\nI wonder how vast it is..."
