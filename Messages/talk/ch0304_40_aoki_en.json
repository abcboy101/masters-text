    "ch0304_40_aoki/2501_0701_02_10": "This is just my opinion, but the best part of\ntraveling is trying out all the local dishes.",

    "ch0304_40_aoki/2501_0702_03_10": "It’s also a good idea to talk to the locals.\nIf a restaurant has been around and loved\nfor a long time, there’s usually a reason...",
