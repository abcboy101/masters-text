    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4001_1001_2000_10": "Surpassing a thousand bonds means Pasio will\ncontinue to grow and develop!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4001_1001_2100_10": "I guess it would be a good opportunity to socialize\nwith everyone!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4001_1001_2200_10": "Of course it would! Let’s start spreading the\nword so all the sync pairs on Pasio start\nsnapping photos!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4001_1001_2300_10": "I’ll spare no cost! I don’t care how many attendees\nend up joining the party!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_0700_10": "Yeah, that’s one thing that’s been consistent since\nwe first met him.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_0800_10": "True, but I think Lear’s changed a lot since then!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_1000_10": "Yup... Remember when we first met Lear?",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_1100_10": "He didn’t care about friendship and treated\npeople and Pokémon like tools! He couldn’t\neven use sync moves!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_1200_10": "He was always looking down on us for working\ntogether as a team, rejecting the idea completely.",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3200_10": "It just shows how much they like you.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3300_10": "Mhm. Especially after becoming a Trainer who\nPokémon can trust.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3400_10": "Oh-ho! Sounds like you’ve got some good stories\nabout Lear, too!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3500_10": "Would you mind sharing them with us?",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3600_10": "Haha, I’d be happy to!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_3700_10": "Hmph! Go on, then!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_4100_10": "Fine! I’ll show you here and now the results of all\nthe training I’ve gone through with Gholdengo!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_4200_10": "Let’s do this, Gholdengo! We’ll show him just how\noutclassed he is!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_4400_10": "Hahaha! Both Lear and Red are raring to go!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4002_1001_4500_10": "You’ll be getting a taste of OUR strength!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_0100_10": "W-wow! He really pushed Red to his limits!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_0200_10": "Bwahahahaha! Of course!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_0301_0600_10": "He says it was a great battle!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_0401_0700_10": "Graaah! How about you look a little more\ndefeated, then?! This is why I don’t like you!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_0302_0800_10": "He’s praising you, Lear!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_0402_0900_10": "Hmph! Not that I need praise from you!\nNot one bit!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1000_10": "Red is acknowledging how strong you are now,\nLear!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1200_10": "Well, I still feel like I should’ve seen more tears\nfrom Red, but I suppose it WAS productive,\nnonetheless.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1300_10": "Anyway, getting back on track!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1400_10": "I’m here to take some photos with you all, as\nproof of our interaction today!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1600_10": "There we go! Got it, Lear!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1700_10": "Well done!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4003_1001_1800_10": "Let’s get going, then! On to the next bond!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4004_1101_0100_20": "The group continued to make good progress\ncollecting photos and eventually reached\na thousand...",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4004_1101_0200_20": "and some time after that, a party was held!",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4004_1001_0300_10": "This is my partner Pokémon, Gholdengo.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4004_1001_0400_10": "I used the sheer power of my wealth to collect\nGimmighoul Coins so that it could evolve!",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_0500_10": "Yeah, the real reason he wanted to throw\nthis party...",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_0600_10": "is ’cause his Gholdengo is, like, suuuuper friendly\nand wanted more friends to play with.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_0700_10": "That’s really why he went out of his way to\nplan an event that lots of people and Pokémon\nwould attend.",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_0800_10": "It was the young master’s way of showing he\ncares.",

    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_1000_10": "So it’s not just their appearances that are bright\nand shiny, huh?",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_1100_10": "Yeah. There's a warm light you can’t see with\nyour eyes, but you can feel with your heart...",
    "episode_event_ch0066_10_boss/4005_1001_1200_10": "And it’s making Lear and Gholdengo shine\neven brighter.",
