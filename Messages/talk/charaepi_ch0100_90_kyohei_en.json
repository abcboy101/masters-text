    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_0200_10": "OK! That was a nice gig! I expected no less from\na Neo Champion!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_0300_10": "You guys showed off some great teamwork\ntoo, Ryuki!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0301_0400_10": "What are you talking about?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0401_0500_10": "A Pokémon battle, of course! Ryuki and I just had\na REALLY fun one!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0302_0600_10": "Just had a Pokémon battle?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0402_0700_10": "Yeah! Ryuki and I just had a red-hot battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_0800_10": "I could feel that you and Haxorus have fiery\nspirits, Nate!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_0900_10": "Not many people can work with dragon Pokémon\nas well as you can!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1000_10": "Wow! It really makes me happy to hear that from\nyou, Ryuki!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1100_10": "I’m surprised, though. Your Haxorus is acting\ntotally different now than he was during our gig. \nHe's so cool and collected.",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1200_10": "During our set, he was as soulful as any dragon\nPokémon—but now? He’s like a whole ’nother\nPokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1300_10": "Yeah, my Haxorus is usually pretty quiet except\nduring battle—then he gets really intense!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1400_10": "I think it’s awesome that he’s such a tough,\nwild fighter!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0301_1500_10": "You too, Nate...",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0401_1600_10": "Huh? Me too?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0302_1700_10": "Kinda like you?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0402_1800_10": "You think I’m kinda like Haxorus?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_1900_10": "I guess I do get really focused when I’m taking a\nbattle seriously.",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2000_10": "I never noticed it myself...but you might be right,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]! Maybe I am kinda\nlike Haxorus!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2100_10": "Hahaha! Nice! It’s important to have an on-off\nswitch like that! You’d get real tired if you were\nalways so soulful!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2200_10": "I’m sure you’re setting a great example for\neveryone else, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2300_10": "Heh heh... Thanks, you two! I feel more\nconfident now!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2400_10": "By the way...what’s your “off” mode like, Ryuki?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_2500_10": "Aren’t you curious, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0301_2600_10": "Yeah, I am!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0401_2700_10": "I thought so! It’d be cool to know what a star like\nRyuki does when he’s not going full throttle!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0302_2800_10": "Tell us!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_0402_2900_10": "See? [Name:PlayerNickname ] wants to know,\ntoo! Won’t you tell us?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3000_10": "You really wanna know?",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3100_10": "Sorry, even my hardcore fans don’t get to know\nstuff like that.",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3200_10": "What I’m like on my own time is a secret!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3300_10": "Aww, OK. That’s disappointing.",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3400_10": "But I guess hiding that side of yourself is pretty\ncool, actually... Just like a star!",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3500_10": "Maybe I’ll try to keep my “off” mode secret too\nwhen I get older...",
    "charaepi_ch0100_90_kyohei/2301_1201_3600_10": "That way, I can be a mysterious Champion!"
