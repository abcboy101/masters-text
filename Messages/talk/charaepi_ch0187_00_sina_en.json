    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_0500_10": "Firstly, I wanted to learn more about how you and\nyour partner operate as a sync pair.",

    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_1300_10": "If you think about it, sync stones are converting\nthe bonds between Trainers and their Pokémon\ninto energy.",
    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_1400_10": "That would explain how they make it possible to\nuse Mega Evolution or unleash special moves!",

    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_2000_10": "And we helped out young Trainers even as we\nresearched.",
    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_2100_10": "People and Pokémon need to support one another,\nafter all.",

    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_2500_10": "The answer, of course, is to stimulate further\ngrowth for me and Glaceon!",

    "charaepi_ch0187_00_sina/2301_1201_2800_10": "By exploring a place as novel as Pasio with\nGlaceon and Dexio...",
