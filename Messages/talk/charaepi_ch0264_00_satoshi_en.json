    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_0300_10": "The strength of these “sync pairs” depends on the\nstrength of the bond between the Trainer and their\npartner Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_0400_10": "So let’s practice using moves together until we’re\nmore in sync than ever!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_0500_10": "OK, ready? Let’s hit that rock with a sync move!",

    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0401_1300_10": "Pikachu’s shocked me plenty of times before, so\nI’m used to it!",

    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0402_1500_10": "Oh, didn’t see you there,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]! Yeah, Pikachu’s\nelectricity sure is impressive!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_1600_10": "Looks like Pikachu and I may have overdone it\na little.",

    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0302_2100_10": "Why?",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0402_2200_10": "Well, Pikachu was my very first partner...",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_2300_10": "At first, we didn’t get along, and he kept\nshocking me all the time. It was a lot to deal with!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0301_2400_10": "What an experience...",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0401_2500_10": "Heh heh... You could say that!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0302_2600_10": "You didn’t put him in a Poké Ball?",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_0402_2700_10": "My Pikachu doesn’t like Poké Balls. I know—it’s\nreally unusual!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_2800_10": "But I wanted to get along with Pikachu more than\nanything, so I decided I’d just meet him head on.",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_2900_10": "While all that was going on, I got attacked by\na flock of Spearow...",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3000_10": "but Pikachu drove them all away with his\nelectricity. He saved me!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3100_10": "That was the first time I felt like we actually\nunderstood each other’s feelings and finally\nbecame friends.",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3200_10": "Since then, I’ve traveled around all sorts of\ndifferent regions and made loads of other friends...",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3300_10": "And Pikachu’s been with me through it all!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3400_10": "I’m confident that the bond between me and\nPikachu is as strong as any sync pair’s on Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3500_10": "So Pikachu and I are sure to keep getting stronger\nand stronger from here on out!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3600_10": "All right! That’s got me all fired up! Come on,\nPikachu! Let’s get back to training!",
    "charaepi_ch0264_00_satoshi/2301_1201_3700_10": "Why don’t you join us,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]? I’m sure we’ll have\na gr—",
