    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1101_0200_20": "But he was struggling to decide what should\nbe featured.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0300_10": "Hmm...",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0400_10": "Young master, if I may... I have a suggestion.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0500_10": "Oh? Let me hear it.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0600_10": "With fashion, no matter the look, the key is the\nperson wearing it. The body is important!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0700_10": "Therefore, I think those with the best-trained\nbodies should be featured!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0800_10": "But then the main feature would be muscles,\nnot fashion, would it not?",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_0900_10": "Although, as you said, the relationship between\nfashion and the body can’t be ignored.",

    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_1100_10": "Some people may object, so you may have to\nbattle them, but...",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_1200_10": "Yes, sir! Leave it to me!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4001_1001_1300_10": "Heh, good response! Now then, be on your way!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0100_10": "So that’s the situation. What do you think?",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0200_10": "I agree, a trained body is beautiful...",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0300_10": "OK. You have my support.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0400_10": "You gotta train to look good in sportswear!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0500_10": "You’ve convinced me, Sawyer!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/4002_1001_0600_10": "Thank you! I’ll be counting on you all!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6801_1031_0100_10": "Sunglasses are wonderful!",

    "episode_event_fashionweek/6802_1001_0300_10": "If you can produce some results, that’d be\nenough to prove my theory!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6802_1001_0400_10": "*chuckle* I could tell from your writings you’re an\ninteresting character...",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6803_1031_0100_10": "Your real face is\nsomething you’d want to\nkeep hidden.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6803_1001_0100_10": "It’s hard to change the design of something you put\non your face all the time.",

    "episode_event_fashionweek/6803_1001_0300_10": "Unlike shoes and clothes, masks can completely\nchange how you come across.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6803_1001_0400_10": "On the other hand, if we wear a mask, then\neven if we show our true face, we may not\nbe recognized.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6804_1031_0100_10": "What curious material!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6804_1001_0100_10": "Where did you get your jacket, Alder?",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6804_1001_0200_10": "I’ve been thinking about it ever since I last saw it!",

    "episode_event_fashionweek/6804_1001_0400_10": "I could tell you...but that’d take away the fun of\nfiguring it out.",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6804_1001_0500_10": "C’mon, don’t be like that. You’ve gotta tell me!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6805_1031_0100_10": "This scarf is so warm!",
    "episode_event_fashionweek/6805_1001_0100_10": "I feel like a lot of people from Sinnoh keep their\nnecks bundled up!",
