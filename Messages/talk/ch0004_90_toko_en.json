    "ch0004_90_toko/7101_0701_01_10": "I never thought I’d be able to battle beside a\nPokémon from the future!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7101_0701_02_10": "I guess there must be loads of encounters\nI can’t even imagine still waiting out there\nfor me!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7101_0701_03_10": "Oooh, I can’t wait!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7102_0701_01_10": "Whether I win or lose, as long as I had fun,\nI have no complaints!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7102_0701_02_10": "Even if I lose, it teaches me how to be\nstronger, and I think that’s fun!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7102_0701_03_10": "Let’s aim to be the best! Keep putting\none foot in front of the other, and head\ntoward the future!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7103_0701_01_10": "Bianca and Cheren—and Nate and Rosa—\nstood on the same stage I did!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7103_0701_02_10": "I’m gonna keep getting stronger until I’m the\nTOP Neo Champion!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7104_0701_01_10": "People and Pokémon aren’t the only things\nthat change with time. Cities and scenery\nchange, too!",

    "ch0004_90_toko/7104_0701_03_10": "Hey, why don’t we hang out in Unova\ntogether?",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7105_0701_01_10": "I’m a Neo Champion now, which means I\nhave to be a role model!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7105_0701_02_10": "So, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...\nLet’s get out there and have some\nserious battles!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7105_0701_03_10": "We’ll show Pasio how we battle!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/7105_0701_04_10": "I won’t let you leave until you’ve shown us\neverything you’ve got!",

    "ch0004_90_toko/2501_0701_01_10": "Paradox Pokémon, from the future...\nHow far into the future are they from?",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2501_0701_02_10": "I bet people in the future look different, too!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2501_0701_03_10": "That said, I’m sure no matter how much we\nchange, the relationship between people and\nPokémon won’t!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2501_0702_01_10": "I’ll keep getting older, until I’m an adult...",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2501_0702_02_10": "I hope even then I can be friends with my\nPokémon!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0701_01_10": "Iron Leaves can split boulders with the\nsharp blades on its neck and forehead!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0701_02_10": "Future Pokémon sure are powerful...",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0701_03_10": "And the more powerful a Pokémon, the more\nskilled its Trainer has to be, too!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0702_01_10": "I wonder what I’ll be like in the future! You\nthink by then I’ll be the strongest Trainer?",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0702_02_10": "I guess it’s all up to how hard I work\nnow, huh?",
    "ch0004_90_toko/2511_0702_03_10": "All right! I’m gonna get even stronger and\nbe the best Trainer ever!",
    "ch0004_90_toko/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Ready to jump into our first battle\nof the day?",
    "ch0004_90_toko/3003_0701_01_10": "Come with me! Whether we’re battling or\nhaving fun, we’re gonna go all out!",
