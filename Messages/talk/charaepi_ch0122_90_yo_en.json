    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0200_10": "Alola! I was just chatting with Leon about\nour partner Pokémon!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0300_10": "Yeah! This is my partner, Calyrex...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0400_10": "And it’s riding atop another Pokémon called\nGlastrier!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0500_10": "Their bond is what helps bring them together\nas one Pokémon, apparently.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0600_10": "And my partner Pokémon is Necrozma!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0700_10": "It’s in Dusk Mane form, which means it\nhas attached itself to Solgaleo.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0800_10": "It seems that doing so allows it to dominate\nSolgaleo’s mind and body.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_0900_10": "In both cases, two different Pokémon come\ntogether to become one...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1000_10": "But I don’t think it’s exactly the same kind of\nmutually supportive relationship that Calyrex\nand Glastrier have.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1100_10": "I also heard that Necrozma devours\nSolgaleo’s light and power...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1200_10": "and that worried me a little.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1300_10": "But those two separate from\neach other sometimes, right?",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1400_10": "Yup. They can, as long as they’re not\nin a battle...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1500_10": "If they can fuse and separate at will, then\nit’s not completely one-sided, is it?",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1600_10": "Hmmm. I guess that’s true...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1700_10": "Now that you mention it, they don’t seem\nto be suffering or anything when they\nseparate from each other...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1800_10": "Maybe it started off one-sided...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_1900_10": "but they eventually realized they could turn\ntheir relationship into something more\ncooperative!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2000_10": "I see...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2100_10": "During my island challenge, I ran into\nall kinds of folks...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2200_10": "Sometimes we couldn’t understand\neach other and clashed...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2300_10": "but I think those moments still helped me\nlearn and grow.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2400_10": "Necrozma and Solgaleo probably overcame\nsome trials of their own.",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_0301_2500_10": "That must be it!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_0401_2600_10": "Yeah! I think so, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_0302_2700_10": "So...they’re buddies now?",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_0402_2800_10": "Probably, yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_2900_10": "And maybe moving forward, experiencing\nall sorts of things together will deepen their\nbond even more!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_3000_10": "All right! Could you and Leon have a battle\nwith me?",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_3100_10": "Sure! Calyrex and I will take you on!",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_3200_10": "Necrozma! Just like how you and Solgaleo\ngot to know each other better...",
    "charaepi_ch0122_90_yo/2301_1201_3300_10": "I’ll do my very best to understand you more\nthrough this battle, too!"
