    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0200_10": "That sure was a fun battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0300_10": "Kyogre’s strength surprised me again!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0400_10": "Seems these Pokémon of legends truly are all\nthey’re cracked up to be.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0500_10": "I’ve studied the legends of Hoenn!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0600_10": "According to them, Kyogre is the personification\nof the sea itself.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0700_10": "They say it widened the seas by causing\ndownpours!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0800_10": "Not only that—Kyogre can become even more\npowerful through Primal Reversion!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_0900_10": "In fact, that’s supposedly its true power—the form\nit took in legends!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_0301_1000_10": "Is it like Mega Evolution?",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_0401_1100_10": "I had that same thought!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_0302_1200_10": "Does it require a strong bond?",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_0402_1300_10": "Good guess, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nYou’re on the right track!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1400_10": "But Primal Reversion is actually different from\nMega Evolution.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1500_10": "For Mega Evolution, you need a Key Stone and a\nMega Stone to resonate with a Pokémon and\nTrainer’s bond.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1600_10": "But Primal Reversion has more to do with the\nenergy of nature!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1700_10": "Of course, I don’t know how much of that is true,\nsince it’s still being researched.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1800_10": "I have a long way to go, both as a Trainer and as\na researcher.",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_1900_10": "But I hope to give future generations accurate\nknowledge of Kyogre!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_2000_10": "I’ll use our time together as a sync pair to\nobserve it...",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_2100_10": "and hopefully grow closer to my goal!",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_2200_10": "So, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_2300_10": "As a Pasio Neo Champion and Kyogre’s Trainer...",
    "charaepi_ch0126_90_haruka/2301_1201_2400_10": "I’d love it if you cheered me on!"
