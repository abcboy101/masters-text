    "ch0199_00_kogomi/0101_0701_02_10": "Come on—let me test out how much tougher\nyou’ve gotten since the last time we met!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7101_0701_01_10": "The Battle Arena is a test of the challengers’ will!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7101_0701_02_10": "Oh, but I mean...you can’t get through with just\nbrute force!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7101_0701_03_10": "’Cause it’s not just about winning or losing—\nchallengers are judged on how they used their\nmind, skill, and body in battle!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7102_0701_01_10": "At the Battle Arena, they call me their leader!\nSounds pretty tough, doesn’t it?",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7102_0701_02_10": "Apparently, it’s because I’m the final boss!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7103_0701_01_10": "I like Fighting-type Pokémon, but I don’t specialize\nin them or anything.",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7103_0701_02_10": "Still though, the Fighting-type users here on Pasio\nare letting me join their training sessions!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7103_0701_03_10": "It’s the best possible environment for me to train\nmy mind, skill, and body!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7104_0701_01_10": "You wanna know how to get stronger? Hmm...\nLet’s see...",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7104_0701_02_10": "If you want to get the most out of your own\nabilities, I think it’s important to have a good\nbalance of mind, skill, and body.",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7104_0701_03_10": "So I’d recommend training in a bunch of different\nways instead of focusing on just one!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7105_0701_01_10": "You’re actually pretty competitive, aren’t you,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7105_0701_02_10": "Right?! That’s what I thought!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/7105_0701_03_10": "There aren’t too many Trainers with a fighting\nspirit as intense as mine!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! I’ve got something I’ve been\nwanting to give you!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/1701_0702_01_10": "I gifted you some of my energy, too! Keep on\ngetting stronger, OK?",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2501_0701_01_10": "When I first met you, I thought you looked pretty\nweak.",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2501_0701_02_10": "But now that I’ve battled on the same team as\nyou, I know just how strong you are!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2501_0701_03_10": "I acknowledge your skill now, and I’m depending\non you too!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2501_0702_01_10": "You know, based on my experience with a Trainer\nI met back in Hoenn...",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2501_0702_02_10": "I’ve got a feeling that you’re gonna keep getting\nstronger, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0701_01_10": "Arrrgh! This is so infuriating!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0701_02_10": "...That’s how I let out my frustration when I lose\na battle that I was trying my hardest to win.",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0701_03_10": "I never hide those feelings of regret!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0701_04_10": "I think...that’s how I show respect to an opponent\nwho defeated me when I wasn’t holding back.",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0702_01_10": "It’s both Trainers taking the battle seriously that\ngives it meaning in the first place!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/2511_0702_02_10": "And that’s why I get SO frustrated when I lose!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/3001_0701_01_10": "Good mooorning! Come on, shout it out from your\ngut! Let’s start another day with lots of energy!",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/3003_0701_01_10": "Gotta keep training as long as the sun’s up!\nHow about you join me?",
    "ch0199_00_kogomi/3005_0701_01_10": "Hmm... I got a lot of good exercise today! Better\nstart prepping for some good rest next!"
