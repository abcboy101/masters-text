    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_0300_10": "Yeah! With all our strength combined, we’re\nunbeatable!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_0400_10": "Cinderace looks pumped, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_0500_10": "Yeah! Maybe it’s ’cause we’re with you, Hop, but\nCinderace seems even more motivated\nthan usual!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0301_0600_10": "What do you mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0401_0700_10": "Hee hee! Well...because Hop and Cinderace have\na really deep connection!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0302_0800_10": "Because of Hop?",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0402_0900_10": "Yeah! They’ve got a really deep connection!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_1000_10": "Hop was the one who gave me the Egg I raised\nCinderace from!",

    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_2000_10": "And I will say that Cinderace’s tendency to get a\nbit TOO enthusiastic can be somewhat of a\nweak point...",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_2100_10": "And, well, who does THAT remind you of?",

    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0401_2500_10": "Well, if he’s combined both our strengths, it’s no\nwonder he’s so strong!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0302_2600_10": "He’s learning from everyone’s\nbest traits.",

    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_0402_2800_10": "When you put it like that, he sounds\nawfully dependable!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_2900_10": "There are so many other people and Pokémon on\nPasio to learn from besides us...",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_3000_10": "I’d like him to keep learning great tips from all of\nthem, to keep growing better and better!",
    "charaepi_ch0243_81_yuri/2301_1201_3100_10": "Heh heh! I’m looking forward to seeing how\nCinderace matures from now on!",
