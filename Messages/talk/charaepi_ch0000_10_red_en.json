    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0401_0400_10": "We were talking about Red and Pikachu.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0302_0500_10": "Oh, is that your Pikachu, Red?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0402_0600_10": "Yeah! They’ve been together since they were\nin Kanto!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_0700_10": "They’ve fought our Pokémon in Gym battles.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_0800_10": "Now that I think about it... You started your\njourney in Pallet Town and used that Pikachu\nin your battle against me.",

    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_1000_10": "Oh! That’s amazing! It must have been destiny!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0301_1100_10": "Yeah, they’re pretty rare!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0401_1200_10": "I see you know your stuff, kid! As I would expect\nfrom a Pikachu Trainer!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0302_1300_10": "How come?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0402_1400_10": "It’s very hard to find a Pikachu in Viridian\nForest! That’s a rare thing!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_1500_10": "I saw a little girl begging her dad for a Pikachu in\nPewter City...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_1600_10": "But it would be hard to find one nearby.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_1700_10": "Anyway, I can’t believe the Pikachu who used to\nstruggle against my Onix has grown so strong!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_1800_10": "It’s kind of inspiring.",

    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_2100_10": "Its fight with my Raichu electrified both of us!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_2200_10": "I could see that Pikachu’s electricity sure is\npowerful! It’s the real deal!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_2300_10": "So then you fought through the Pokémon League\nwith other Pokémon—and even discovered new \npowers here on Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0301_2400_10": "Could it be...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0401_2500_10": "Precisely! It’s Dynamax!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0302_2600_10": "New powers?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_0402_2700_10": "Red and Pikachu can use max moves!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_2800_10": "Also, I heard Red’s Pikachu can Gigantamax!",

    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3000_10": "Even in the Galar region, Pokémon that can\nGigantamax are special.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3100_10": "How is it possible that a Pikachu from the Kanto\nregion can Gigantamax?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3200_10": "I guess there are still a lot of mysteries\nabout Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3300_10": "We don’t know if Pikachu already had that power\nburied inside him or if Red’s training was just\nreally good, but...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3400_10": "It’s true that Red’s Pikachu has grown stronger!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3500_10": "As someone who used to battle against Red with\nall my might...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_10_red/2301_1201_3600_10": "I’d better work hard to not lose to you,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ], since you’ve also got\na Pikachu!",
