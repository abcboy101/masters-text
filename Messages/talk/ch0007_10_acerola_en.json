    "ch0007_10_acerola/7101_0701_01_10": "Tapu Bulu is super strong, but it doesn’t seem to\nlike conflict.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7101_0701_02_10": "Apparently, the Tapu Bulu in Alola lives in ruins\nin the desert.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7101_0701_03_10": "Since it doesn’t like to fight, maybe that’s why it\nhangs around places no one really visits.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7102_0701_01_10": "Tapu Bulu is usually gentle and calm, but it’s scary\nwhen it gets angry!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7102_0701_02_10": "Make sure you take care of the environment so it\ndoesn’t get upset!",

    "ch0007_10_acerola/7103_0701_02_10": "It’s cute, but there’s also something really majestic\nabout it, don’t ya think?",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7103_0701_03_10": "Isn’t it stylish? I love it so much!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7104_0701_01_10": "I come from a bloodline of people who did\namazing things a long, long time ago!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7104_0701_02_10": "I hope I can be just as awesome as them when I\ngrow up!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7105_0701_01_10": "Do you think there’s a cool secret in your\nlineage, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7105_0701_02_10": "I’ve been wondering about it since you’re such a\nskilled Trainer!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7105_0701_03_10": "If I’m from old royalty, maybe you come\nfrom a family of brave heroes,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/7105_0701_04_10": "Wouldn’t that be funny!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/1701_0701_01_10": "Hiya! Take this!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/1701_0702_01_10": "If I find anything else good, I’ll be sure to share it\nwith you!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2501_0701_01_10": "Tapu Bulu makes ringing sounds with its tail to let\nits enemies know where it is. It avoids conflict\nthat way!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2501_0701_02_10": "But sometimes it makes those sounds even when\nno one’s around.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2501_0701_03_10": "Strange, right? I wonder what it’s trying to\nkeep away.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2501_0702_01_10": "I wish I could see whatever it is that\nTapu Bulu sees.",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2501_0702_02_10": "Then we could be even better friends!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2511_0701_01_10": "People in ancient times were pretty amazing.\nThey lived out in the wild!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2511_0701_02_10": "I’d get lost if I went out at night without any light!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2511_0701_03_10": "If that ever happens, will you come save me?\n*giggle*",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/2511_0702_01_10": "Even in complete darkness, I’d feel safer if we\nwere together!",

    "ch0007_10_acerola/3003_0701_01_10": "Even though Pasio’s an artificial island, it has a lot\nof nature, which is really awesome!",
    "ch0007_10_acerola/3005_0701_01_10": "*yawn* I’m getting sleepy. I hope I have the same\ndream as my Pokémon."
