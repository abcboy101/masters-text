    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0402_0600_10": "Oh, hi, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Not much.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_0700_10": "I was just gazing out at the ocean with Lycanroc.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_0800_10": "I was thinking we could watch the sunset, then\nhead back once it got dark.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0301_0900_10": "You’ve changed.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0401_1000_10": "Yeah...I guess that’s true.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0302_1100_10": "I think spending time together like\nthat is important.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0402_1200_10": "Yeah...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0402_1300_10": "So you think so, too, [Name:PlayerNickname ]...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_1400_10": "Before, I felt like I needed to rush. That feeling is\ngone now.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_1500_10": "That’s why I’m taking a page out of Tina’s book...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_1600_10": "and spending more time like this with Lycanroc\ninstead of forcing ourselves to train.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0301_1700_10": "Lycanroc looks happy, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0401_1800_10": "Yeah. His appearance may have changed, but he’s\nstill the same friendly pup as before.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0302_1900_10": "How’s Lycanroc doing?",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0402_2000_10": "Haha, I bet he wants to spend some time with\nyou, too, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2100_10": "Lycanroc...or rather, Rockruff...was the very first\nPokémon I got when I started out as a Trainer.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2200_10": "That’s why I was always a little worried about not\nbeing able to evolve him for so long...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2300_10": "Where I come from, Rockruff is a relatively rare\nPokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2400_10": "Professor Bellis told me that maybe he wasn’t\ncompatible with that environment.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2500_10": "But...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2600_10": "I personally think there were other reasons why\nRockruff didn’t evolve.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2700_10": "I think maybe he was waiting until I was ready\nto handle his evolved form, Lycanroc...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2800_10": "In other words, he was waiting for me to grow\nas a Trainer before evolving. That’s my theory.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_2900_10": "Sometimes, inexperienced Trainers get\noverwhelmed when their Pokémon become\nreally powerful after evolving.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3000_10": "I bet Rockruff could tell I was worried and\nrushing.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3100_10": "So in a way, I think him not evolving was a\nreflection of myself and all the parts of me that\nhadn’t matured yet.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3200_10": "Well...maybe that’s just wishful thinking on\nmy part.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3300_10": "Either way, Lycanroc is still by my side.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3400_10": "In order to live up to the trust and hope he’s put\nin me...",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_3500_10": "I’ll definitely beat you one day.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0301_3600_10": "I won’t lose!",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0401_3700_10": "Yeah, I won’t either!",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0302_3800_10": "Bring it on!",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_0402_3900_10": "*chuckle* Thanks.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_4000_10": "But...maybe another time.",
    "charaepi_ch0064_01_rival/2301_1201_4100_10": "Right now, let’s just enjoy spending time with\nour Pokémon."
