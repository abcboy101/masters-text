    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_0301_1700_10": "I wonder what that class would be\nlike!",

    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2400_10": "Yeah! I wanna go!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2500_10": "OK, let’s make that our next stop!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2600_10": "I’m curious, too. But I actually wanted to\nsit in on Mr. Jacq’s biology class.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2700_10": "He’s going to talk about the Terastal\nphenomenon, so I was curious, too!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2800_10": "Why don’t we split into two groups, then?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_2900_10": "I’ll lead the way to Mr. Jacq’s class!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_3000_10": "And we’ll head to the computer class!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4003_1001_3100_10": "OK! See you later!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0100_10": "I’m here for the programming class.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0200_10": "Oh. Hi. Then...you can sit over there...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0300_10": "Wait...Juliana?!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0400_10": "Penny? You’re the teacher?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0500_10": "Um...well... I’m helping out the usual teacher\nby substituting.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0600_10": "I know a lot about computers, so I figured I\ncould teach for a bit.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0700_10": "I wasn’t expecting so many people to show\nup, though. Now I’m getting nervous...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0800_10": "Don’t worry. They’re just here to observe\ntoday.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_0900_10": "Let’s start the lesson, shall we, Teach?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1000_10": "O-OK. Then...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1100_10": "...And that’s how it works. Does that make\nsense?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1200_10": "This is way more complicated than I \nexpected!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1300_10": "Computers are hard!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1400_10": "Aw, I didn’t understand any of it!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1500_10": "Don’t feel bad if you didn’t get it. This is the\npart where a lot of beginners struggle.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1600_10": "Sorry, Teach. Could you explain it again?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1700_10": "I won’t give up! Not until I get it!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1800_10": "S-sure...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_1900_10": "But why do you want to understand so\nbadly? We don’t have any exams coming up.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2000_10": "Actually...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2100_10": "It’s so I can get to know this guy better.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2200_10": "Porygon-Z’s a Pokémon that was created\nartificially, and it has a strong connection to\ncomputer programming.",

    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2400_10": "Oh, so that’s why!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2500_10": "So for its sake...let’s try again, Teach.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2600_10": "OK. Understood.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2700_10": "Let’s try a different method this time...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2800_10": "Is there anything we can do to help him get\nalong better with Porygon-Z?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_2900_10": "Maybe we could try learning about\ncomputers alongside Gladion.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_3000_10": "I’m sure it’ll be more fun if we all study\ntogether!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_3100_10": "Yeah! That’s true!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_3200_10": "OK! We’re gonna learn how to make some\nAWESOME programs!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4004_1001_3300_10": "Looks like Penny’s programming class is\ngonna be lively!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer/4005_1101_0100_20": "Days later...",
