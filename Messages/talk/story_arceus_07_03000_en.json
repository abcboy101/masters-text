    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_0400_10": "Were you so scared to battle alone that you\ncalled for backup?",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_0500_10": "Heh, jealous? MY protégés are dependable.",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_0600_10": "The three of us could just take you down\nright here.",

    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_1400_10": "But how? They haven’t been giving them out\nto troublemakers like you!",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_1500_10": "Don’t tell me you stole them!",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_1600_10": "I haven’t stolen a thing. Luckily, someone\nwas willing to part with theirs.",

    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_2400_10": "Yeah! What Blue said!",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_2500_10": "If you treat Pokémon like tools, there’s no\nway you’ll get an arc suit!",

    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_3000_10": "We could battle here and now, but that\nwouldn’t solve anything.",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_3100_10": "Then why are you here?",

    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_4000_10": "I suppose that’s your way of luring us\ninto the arena, where it’s easier to\napprehend us.",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_4100_10": "My subordinates are right...though your offer\nIS compelling.",
    "story_arceus_07_03000/2401_1001_4200_10": "I could also talk to Lear and that guy from\nthe International Police and get them to stay\nout of it, if that’d help.",
