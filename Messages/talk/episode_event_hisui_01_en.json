    "episode_event_hisui_01/4003_1001_2900_10": "Apparently, they suddenly fell from the sky one\nday. And if I remember correctly...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4003_1001_3000_10": "That’s it! It was from a rift!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4003_1001_3100_10": "There was a rift when we showed up here, too!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4003_1001_3200_10": "Right! Why didn’t I realize it sooner! I’m such\na fool!",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1000_10": "It’s a space-time distortion.",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1200_10": "Yeah. It’s a dangerous phenomenon that sometimes\noccurred back in Hisui.",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1500_10": "Does that mean the ones on Pasio will, too?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1600_10": "No, I’m afraid the ones on Pasio...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1700_10": "aren’t showing signs of disappearing. In fact,\nthey’re getting bigger.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_1800_10": "That’s...dangerous.",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4004_1001_2000_10": "But if it’s just a lot of Pokémon showing up, that’s\nnot exactly scary, right?",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4005_1001_2000_10": "This could benefit Master Cyrus, so we’ll hear you\nout. But don’t you dare try anything funny!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0100_10": "Um, so the reason why we’re here is—",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0200_10": "You don’t need to explain.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0300_10": "I already know why you’re here.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0400_10": "However, I have no intention of cooperating with\nthe likes of you.",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0600_10": "The Galaxy Team’s mission is for people and\nPokémon to coexist for the peace and safety of the\nworld, right?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0700_10": "I don’t know what organization you’re mistaking\nus for, but Team Galactic has one mission—",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0800_10": "to create a perfect world.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_0900_10": "I guess Team Galactic is different from the Galaxy\nTeam we know.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1000_10": "If you’re hoping for goodwill, leave now. You\nwon’t find such ambiguous things here.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1100_10": "His blunt personality...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1200_10": "Yeah, it reminds me of someone...",

    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1400_10": "What is it, Palkia?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1500_10": "Ugh!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1600_10": "Adaman! Irida! What’s wrong?!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1700_10": "This is...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1800_10": "My head... Mighty Dialga’s talking...inside\nmy head!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_1900_10": "It’s telling me to use the power of time and space\nto ease the space-time distortion...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2000_10": "Mighty Palkia is telling me that we can stop the\nspace-time distortion from spreading by\nworking together!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2100_10": "Dialga and Palkia are speaking to you?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2200_10": "How unscientific.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2300_10": "However, it does coincide with some of Team\nGalactic’s research. ",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2400_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2500_10": "Time and space...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2600_10": "If a large number of wild Pokémon are appearing\nin this phenomenon’s vicinity...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2700_10": "I can hypothesize it’s because various times and\nspaces are connected.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2800_10": "If we assume your hypothesis is correct...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_2900_10": "There’s a chance the disturbances are forming\nbecause the balance between time and space\nhas been disrupted.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3000_10": "If so, we might be able to use the power of time\nand space to restore balance and stop\nthe distortions!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3100_10": "Yeah, sounds great!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3200_10": "What do you think, as one who has a connection\nto mighty Palkia?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3300_10": "Fine. I’ll cooperate.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3400_10": "I’m curious whether this will prove my hypothesis\ncorrect—and what the results will show.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3500_10": "Excellent! With mighty Palkia’s cooperation,\nI’m much more confident this will go well!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3600_10": "So, what’s the plan?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3700_10": "Within the distortion, wild Pokémon will become\nan obstacle.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3800_10": "It would be more effective, then, to apply force\nfrom outside the distortion, in a pincer movement.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_3900_10": "So we’ll have mighty Palkia and Dialga working\nfrom opposite sides of the distortion.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_4000_10": "Sounds like a plan!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4006_1001_4100_10": "Let’s split up and get started!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4007_1001_0100_10": "OK! Time to call upon mighty Dialga to lend us\nits power!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4007_1001_0200_10": "Dialga... Can you help us, please?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0100_10": "Hey... The distortion seems to be getting bigger...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0200_10": "Why? How could this happen when mighty Palkia\nis trying to stop it?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0300_10": "M-Master Cyrus!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0400_10": "Two powers were not enough...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0500_10": "At this rate...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0600_10": "No, wait! The distortion stopped growing!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0700_10": "And...it looks like it’s coming to an end!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0800_10": "I knew you could do it, mighty Palkia!\nYour power worked!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_0900_10": "(There was a third power at work here, from that\nreverse world that doesn’t follow the laws\nof physics...)",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4008_1001_1000_10": "Hmph. So she’s here, too.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4009_1001_0100_10": "We did it! It’s getting smaller and smaller!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4009_1001_0200_10": "Let’s finish this quickly!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4009_1001_0300_10": "I have a lot of questions for those two Professor\nBellis mentioned, who everyone’s talking about!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0100_10": "W-we did it! The space-time distortion is gone!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0200_10": "It’s really over?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0300_10": "Yeah!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0400_10": "You’re a lifesaver, Dialga! It’s all thanks to you\nlending us your power!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0500_10": "(Once again, people and Pokémon\njoined together...)",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0600_10": "(and saved the world from destruction.)",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4010_1001_0700_10": "Looks like it’s time for us to make a decision.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1101_0100_20": "Later on...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0200_10": "Huh? The rift is still open?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0300_10": "And you’re saying more space-time distortions\nhave been forming, too?!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0400_10": "Occasionally, yes. But on a smaller scale.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0500_10": "So we didn’t fix the root of the problem...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0600_10": "Don’t worry. We were able to stop the worst of it,\nweren’t we?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0700_10": "If anything happens again, I’m sure we can\nresolve it together.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0800_10": "Huh? But I thought you two wanted to get back\nhome as soon as possible.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_0900_10": "Well...we do, but we don’t know how.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1000_10": "So for now, we’ve decided to stay here on Pasio\nuntil we figure it out!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1100_10": "Other people and Pokémon from Hisui might come\nhere, too...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1200_10": "So we’ll be sure to take care of them if they do.\nLeave it to us!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1300_10": "Are you sure?",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1400_10": "Yeah. Our minds are made up.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1500_10": "As proof of how serious we are, we even have\nLeafeon and Glaceon in Poké Balls now.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1600_10": "When someone from Hisui comes here, or when\nwe eventually find our way back there...",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1700_10": "We’ll have to set the example and show them how\npeople and Pokémon can live together in harmony.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1800_10": "Sync pairs are the perfect example!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_1900_10": "So please, let us stay and learn from all of you!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_2000_10": "Sure, of course!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_2100_10": "*chuckle* I can tell it’s going to get lively here.",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_2200_10": "Let’s give it our best, Adaman, Irida!",
    "episode_event_hisui_01/4011_1001_2300_10": "You got it! Since we’ll be here a while, let’s help\neach other out!"
