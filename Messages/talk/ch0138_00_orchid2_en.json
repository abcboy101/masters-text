    "ch0138_00_orchid2/0101_0701_02_10": "I would quite like to see how you’re growing\nstronger day by day as you travel around\nthe island of Pasio!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7101_0701_01_10": "Ah, regional variants...",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7101_0701_02_10": "They arise when the influences of a\nparticular region change a Pokémon’s\nphysical aspects—and even its type.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7101_0701_03_10": "I think people are much the same—we\nadapt to our environment, too!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7101_0701_04_10": "Take Alola, for instance—people there\nare often easygoing and open-minded.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7102_0701_01_10": "Pokémon that are regional variants have\nappearances that are well suited to the\nunique natural environments of their regions.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7102_0701_02_10": "However, some Pokémon have different\nappearances depending on their habitats,\neven if they come from the same region!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7102_0701_03_10": "What’s the difference between these two\ncases? There’s a lot of research out there to\ndive into!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7103_0701_01_10": "Even though regions and environments may\nchange, the connection between people and\nPokémon hasn’t.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7103_0701_02_10": "Seeing the sync pairs on Pasio really makes\nme feel that!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7103_0701_03_10": "No matter what kind of Pokémon we might\ncome across in the future, I’m sure we’ll find\na way to coexist with them.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7104_0701_01_10": "At times, Pokémon thought to be the same\nspecies because of similar appearances turn\nout to be completely different species!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7104_0701_02_10": "There are quite a few Pokémon out there\nlike that.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7104_0701_03_10": "As a researcher of regional variants, I’m\nalways curious to know what made them\nso alike!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7105_0701_01_10": "My specialty is Pokémon research...",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7105_0701_02_10": "but I’d say I’m pretty decent at battling, too!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7105_0701_03_10": "If you don’t mind, how about we have a\nmatch, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/7105_0701_04_10": "Now that I’m here on Pasio, I might as well\nenjoy some battling!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/1701_0701_01_10": "Ah, perfect timing! Here, I’ll give you this!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/1701_0702_01_10": "I’m confident you’ll keep excelling!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0701_01_10": "Have you ever heard of Alola’s sport,\nMantine Surfing?",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0701_02_10": "You ride a Mantine, surfing the waves\nbetween islands while competing for the\nhighest score!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0701_03_10": "It’s a bit tricky to get a hang of at first, but\nonce you get used to it...you’ll be hooked!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0702_01_10": "To tell you the truth, I’m actually ranked\nthird in Mantine Surfing!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0702_02_10": "Well...",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2501_0702_03_10": "Unless the records have been updated since\nthen...",

    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2511_0701_03_10": "And as much love and care as any parent\nwould—both for the Pokédex and Rotom!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2511_0702_01_10": "If you meet a Trainer with a Rotom Pokédex,\nyou should ask them to show it to you!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/2511_0702_02_10": "I’m sure Rotom would also want to chat!",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/3001_0701_01_10": "Oh, hello! Hello! Alola! I’d love some help\nwith my research if you’ve got some time.",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/3003_0701_01_10": "The beaches here on Pasio get some pretty\nnice waves! What do you think? Care to\njoin me?",
    "ch0138_00_orchid2/3005_0701_01_10": "In Alola, Pokémon called Minior drop down\nfrom space just like falling stars."
