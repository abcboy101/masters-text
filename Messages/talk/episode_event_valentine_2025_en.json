    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_0800_10": "It’s amazing... Are you sure I can keep it?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_0900_10": "Yes, of course.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1000_10": "Thank you, Erika...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1100_10": "All righty, then! How ’bout we put our heads\ntogether and decide on the bouquets we ought to\nmake, eh?",

    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1300_10": "Not really... I don’t really know much about\nflowers, to be honest...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1400_10": "Then why don’t you pick flowers that the people\nyou want to give them to like?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1500_10": "I guess you could ask Marnie’s brother, Piers,\nwhat kind of flowers she’d like.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1600_10": "And for Elesa... Hmm. I know what kind of FOOD\nshe likes, but...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1700_10": "Oh? What was that?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1800_10": "Oh! Everyone, look!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_1900_10": "What Pokémon is that?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2000_10": "Well, ain’t that a cute little critter!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2100_10": "It looks like a Grass-type Pokémon...right?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2200_10": "Wait, is it Shaymin?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2300_10": "Shaymin? Like Rosa’s partner Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2400_10": "I saw hers when she was working as a tourism\nambassador, but it looked kinda different.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2600_10": "Oh yeah, Elio and Selene said Rosa mentioned\nsomething like that, too!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2700_10": "So you really think that Pokémon’s a Shaymin?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2800_10": "It keeps looking at us. I wonder why.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_2900_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3000_10": "Oh...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3100_10": "Hey, what kinda Pokémon is Shaymin?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3200_10": "People say Shaymin are associated with feelings\nof gratitude.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3300_10": "Perhaps it was drawn to Marley. That might be\nwhy it came so close.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3400_10": "To me?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3500_10": "Yes, I think it sensed your feelings of gratitude.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4003_1001_3600_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0100_10": "Have you collected all the flowers you need,\nMarley?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0200_10": "Yeah, I was able to find the ones you told\nme about.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0300_10": "That’s great!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0400_10": "We have almost all the materials we need for\nthe bouquets.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0500_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0600_10": "What’s the matter?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0700_10": "Oh, um... I was wondering if Shaymin was still\naround somewhere.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0800_10": "That Shaymin is still on your mind, isn’t it.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_0900_10": "Oh, Marley—look.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1000_10": "Shaymin...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1100_10": "Oh...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1200_10": "It seems pretty cautious.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1300_10": "Should I leave it alone?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1400_10": "I’m not so sure...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1500_10": "If it wanted to be left alone, I don’t think it\nwould’ve shown itself.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1600_10": "I’d say it’s definitely curious about you, Marley.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1700_10": "(Maybe Shaymin doesn’t know what to do either.)",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4004_1001_1800_10": "(And if that’s true...)",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0100_10": "Now you’ve all the flowers you need for\nthe bouquets!",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0200_10": "All I need to do is give these to them...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0300_10": "Oh, it’s back...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0400_10": "Marley, let’s ask Lurantis to help us.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0500_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0600_10": "Lurantis can coax other Pokémon to come closer\nby giving off a scent of sweet flowers.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0700_10": "She might be able to make Shaymin less wary.",

    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_0900_10": "That smells so nice...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1000_10": "But...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1100_10": "Aw, that’s a shame. It didn’t seem to have\nmuch effect.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1200_10": "I wonder why Shaymin won’t come closer.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1300_10": "I think...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1400_10": "Shaymin is kinda how I was a while ago...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1500_10": "What do you mean?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1600_10": "I found it really hard to speak... I didn’t want to\nhurt anyone’s feelings by saying something wrong,\nso I kept my mouth shut...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1700_10": "But to tell the truth, I was just afraid of my own\nfeelings being hurt...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1800_10": "I didn’t want anyone to dislike me...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_1900_10": "I thought it better to do nothing—better to stay the\nway I was—than to risk getting hurt.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2000_10": "Maybe Shaymin feels the same way...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2100_10": "It wants to come closer, but every time it does,\nit’s unsure and afraid. Bittersweet, isn’t it?",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2200_10": "I wonder if there’s anything we can do to help.",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2300_10": "We can’t force it to do anything, but we can give\nit courage...",

    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2500_10": "Yeah...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2600_10": "Just like Elesa and Marnie gave to me...",
    "episode_event_valentine_2025/4005_1001_2700_10": "You don’t have to be afraid to express yourself.",
