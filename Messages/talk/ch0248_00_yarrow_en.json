    "ch0248_00_yarrow/0101_0701_02_10": "It’s time to harvest the fruits of our training!",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7101_0701_01_10": "I’m the Gym Leader of Turffield—a quiet,\neasygoing town surrounded by farming fields.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7101_0701_02_10": "But it also has some mysterious standing stones\nand a geoglyph, so we get a fair number of\ntourists as well.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7102_0701_01_10": "I’m the first Gym Leader people face in the Galar\nGym Challenge.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7102_0701_02_10": "But when I’m up against a newbie Trainer, I can’t\nhelp but want to treat them gently and help them\ngrow like a new sprout...",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7102_0701_03_10": "That makes for pretty low difficulty, which I\nsuppose is perfect for the first Gym, huh.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7103_0701_01_10": "In both battling and farming, having a solid\nfoundation is key.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7103_0701_02_10": "In farming, that means preparing the soil!\nIn battling, I guess the equivalent would be daily\ntraining and research, maybe?",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7103_0701_03_10": "In order to bloom beautifully, you’ve got to be\npatient and prepare diligently!",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7104_0701_01_10": "Nessa and Kabu are good friends and rivals\nof mine.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7104_0701_02_10": "The types we specialize in balance each other,\nso we always try to support each other.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/7105_0701_01_10": "Farming is a job that’s full of surprises. I think the\nsame applies to Pokémon battles and life in\ngeneral, too.",

    "ch0248_00_yarrow/1701_0701_01_10": "Would you like this, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/1701_0702_01_10": "I found it when I was working...but I figure you’d\nmake the item happier than I ever could!",

    "ch0248_00_yarrow/2501_0701_02_10": "As a result, I grew up big and strong, and I’ve\nbeen able to hone my teamwork with my\nPokémon!",

    "ch0248_00_yarrow/2511_0701_01_10": "I’ve been able to have loads of serious battles\nhere on Pasio.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/2511_0701_02_10": "That’s partly because there’re so many strong\nTrainers here that I don’t have to hold back\nagainst...",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/2511_0701_03_10": "But also, I just naturally go all out when I step in\nto protect others from troublemakers like\nTeam Break.",
    "ch0248_00_yarrow/2511_0702_01_10": "I can’t go all out in battles against newbie\nTrainers, but even those are quite fun!",

    "ch0248_00_yarrow/3003_0701_01_10": "Pasio may be an artificial island, but it sure has\ngreat soil. I bet I could grow scrumptious\nBerries here!",
