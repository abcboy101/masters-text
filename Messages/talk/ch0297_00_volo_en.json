    "ch0297_00_volo/7101_0701_01_10": "If you ever want to learn about Hisuian history,\nthen I’m your man!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7101_0701_02_10": "I’ve spent plenty of time studying such things\ninstead of—",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7101_0701_03_10": "Ahem, I mean while also tirelessly doing my work\nfor the Ginkgo Guild. And I’ve visited many of the\nruins in the Hisui region!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7102_0701_01_10": "Curiosity and a hunger for knowledge are what\ndrive people to grow and improve... Don’t you\nagree?",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7102_0701_02_10": "The culture here on Pasio—or rather, here in the\nfuture—has advanced so far beyond what we had\nin Hisui.",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7102_0701_03_10": "Ever striving for greater heights, gaining\nundiscovered knowledge... That is humanity’s true\nnature!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7103_0701_01_10": "Do you have a moment? I’ve got a real bargain\nfor—",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7103_0701_02_10": "What? You don’t want it? You think I’m\nsuspicious somehow?",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7103_0701_03_10": "Oh, have some mercy! Can’t you see I’m dying to\ntell you about it?",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7104_0701_01_10": "Surely you understand the sense of elation\nexperienced when unraveling the shrouds of\nmystery surrounding history and legends!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7104_0701_02_10": "Said legends and history allow us to more deeply\nunderstand our world—they are the best things in\nlife!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/7105_0701_01_10": "You have a magnetic quality that draws in\neveryone around you, [Name:PlayerNickname ].\nI wonder if you were born with it.",

    "ch0297_00_volo/7105_0701_03_10": "Perhaps you are special—like you’re some kind of\nchosen one!",

    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0701_02_10": "I couldn’t help but wonder why life was so unfair.\nWhy I was cursed to live through such things.",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0701_03_10": "Of course, I imagine we all go through something\nlike that... What about you?",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0702_01_10": "Eventually, I chose to direct all my energy into my\nown natural curiosity and ambition.",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0702_02_10": "And what tickled my curiosity more strongly than\nanything were the mysteries to be found in\nlegends, in history, in ruins.",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0702_03_10": "You see, I fancied that by unraveling these\nmysteries, I could find out how the world itself\ncame to be...",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2501_0702_04_10": "and with that knowledge, maybe even forge a\nnew, better world!",

    "ch0297_00_volo/2511_0702_01_10": "To be a sync pair is to share both joy and\nsadness...",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2511_0702_02_10": "To be the kind of person who follows their dreams\nwith their Pokemon by their side, I suppose...",
    "ch0297_00_volo/2511_0702_03_10": "It makes me wonder what sorts of stories Pasio’s\nsync pairs have in store for me.",
    "ch0297_00_volo/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! Are you heading out today? In that\ncase, Potions are a must!",
    "ch0297_00_volo/3003_0701_01_10": "The weather outside is lovely today! So how\nabout it? Care to go on an outing with me?",
    "ch0297_00_volo/3005_0701_01_10": "Please, don’t overexert yourself too late at night.\nI don’t want to lose one of my loyal customers!"
