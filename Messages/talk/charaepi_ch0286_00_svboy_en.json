    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_0200_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_0300_10": "I was just taking a look around town. The weather\nsure is great today, isn’t it?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_0400_10": "Weather this good makes me want to go on a\npicnic! Right, Miraidon?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_0500_10": "Hm? What’s the matter? Oh, are you curious\nabout Miraidon?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0301_0600_10": "I sure am!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0401_0700_10": "I had a feeling! Any Pokémon Trainer would be\ncurious about Miraidon!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0302_0800_10": "What a unique Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0402_0900_10": "Yeah, for a Pokémon, Miraidon is a little unique.\nNo, make that VERY unique.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1000_10": "Have you heard of Cyclizar, \n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1100_10": "It’s a Pokémon said to have lived alongside people\nin the Paldea region since ancient times.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1200_10": "But Miraidon might actually be a future form of\nCyclizar!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0301_1300_10": "It’s from the future?!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0401_1400_10": "That’s right! But it’s not quite the same as\nEvolution!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0302_1500_10": "You mean like...Evolution?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_0402_1600_10": "Nope! It’s not Evolution—it’s a future form!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1700_10": "It’s been hypothesized that in the distant future, \nCyclizar will come to look like Miraidon.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1800_10": "Sometimes Pokémon of the same species can look\ndifferent depending on the region they’re from, but\nit seems Miraidon’s case is something different.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_1900_10": "There’s still no concrete evidence, though, so it \nremains strictly speculation.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2000_10": "But if it really is true, I wonder if its appearance\nchanged slowly over a long period of time.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2100_10": "Or maybe it changed suddenly, like with Evolution?",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2200_10": "Don’t you get excited just thinking about it?\nPokémon really are mysterious!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2300_10": "But when I think about it...",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2400_10": "I guess it’s just as mysterious as me being in this\nworld right now.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2500_10": "I’ve managed to come to such a wonderful place,\nso I plan on using the opportunity to learn a lot!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2600_10": "Well, at any rate, every day since coming to Pasio\nhas been a blast!",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2700_10": "I also feel like I’ve gotten closer to Miraidon after\nexperiencing something similar to what it did.",
    "charaepi_ch0286_00_svboy/2301_1201_2800_10": "And so... I hope you keep being a great friend to \nme and Miraidon!"
