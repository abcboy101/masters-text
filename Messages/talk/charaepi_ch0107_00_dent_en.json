    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1101_0200_20": "They found some rare tea leaves and bought\nthe last pack.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_0300_10": "We sure lucked out! They don’t sell this sort\nof tea in Unova, so I’m looking forward to\ntasting it!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_0400_10": "Apparently they’re fermented leaves that\nPokémon like.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_0500_10": "Oh? Simisage seems curious...",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_0600_10": "That must mean these leaves are on the\nbitter side.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0301_0700_10": "How can you tell?",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0401_0800_10": "The leaves on Simisage’s head are really\nbitter, so I figured!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0302_0900_10": "Does he like bitter things?",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0402_1000_10": "Not really, but the leaves on his head are\nreally bitter, so I thought there might be a\nconnection there!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_1100_10": "Before he evolved, he was a Pansage with\nleaves that could relieve fatigue.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_1200_10": "I wonder—when it evolves, does even its\nleaves’ flavor mature?",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_1300_10": "As they say, the longer you live, the more\nyou’ll have tasted both the bitter and the\nsweet.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0301_1400_10": "I like sweet things!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0401_1500_10": "It may take you a while to appreciate\nsour and bitter flavors.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0302_1600_10": "I wanna try more mature flavors, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0402_1700_10": "Good idea. I, Cilan, can help by making you\nthe finest teas.",

    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_2000_10": "It makes me wonder how our flavors will\nhave changed when we return to the\nStriaton City Gym!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0301_2100_10": "I’m looking forward to it!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0401_2200_10": "Thank you. I’m looking forward to it, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0302_2300_10": "Take your time fermenting!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0402_2400_10": "Ahahaha! That’s an interesting way to put it!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_0402_2500_10": "You’re not wrong, though! Putting time and\ncare into something is sure to help bring out\nits flavor!",
    "charaepi_ch0107_00_dent/2301_1201_2600_10": "Hm? Oh, you want to know what I want to\ndo? Well...",
