    "ch0289_00_nemo/7101_0701_02_10": "You can learn about tons of things other than\nPokémon, so that’s fun!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7101_0701_03_10": "Getting to school can be really tough if you’re not\nin the dorms ’cause there’s so many stairs!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7102_0701_01_10": "There’s so many Pokémon on Pasio that you don’t\nsee in Paldea!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7102_0701_02_10": "Any Pokémon’s fun to battle!",

    "ch0289_00_nemo/7103_0701_02_10": "That’s the way we do things in Paldea, but...",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7103_0701_03_10": "apparently, there’s places where making eye\ncontact means a Pokémon battle has to start.",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7103_0701_04_10": "Isn’t that just the best?!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7104_0701_01_10": "I learned how to use my sync move as soon as I\ncame to Pasio.",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/7104_0701_02_10": "So now I have to see how much I can hone it!",

    "ch0289_00_nemo/2501_0701_02_10": "But there aren’t any wild Pokémon on Pasio...",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2501_0701_03_10": "So I’m kinda relieved. No one here will see that\nuncool side of me...",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2501_0702_01_10": "But I can’t be bad forever!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2501_0702_02_10": "Let’s have a Pokémon-catching training session\nsometime, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2511_0701_01_10": "It’s impressive when someone gets really good\nat something because they were passionate and\nspent a lot of time on it!",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2511_0701_02_10": "That’s not an easy thing for everyone to do...",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2511_0701_03_10": "I don’t think I’m incredible or anything, but I felt\nset apart from everyone else.",
    "ch0289_00_nemo/2511_0701_04_10": "Sometimes I’d go easy on my friends in battle\nso we both could enjoy it.",
