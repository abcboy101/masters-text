    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0200_10": "Ah! [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0300_10": "I was just asking these two what they\nthought about Necrozma!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0400_10": "People say that this form of Necrozma\nforcibly latched onto Lunala.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0500_10": "So, I was kinda worried that they might be\nhurting because of that.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0600_10": "Neither of the Pokémon are saying that\nthey’re distressed, though.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0700_10": "They’re both in agreement that they’re\nsupporting each other.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0800_10": "If N says so, then I guess there’s nothing to\nworry about!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_0900_10": "Thank goodness! I’m so glad I asked you\ntwo for advice!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1000_10": "If they really were hurting in any way from\ntheir fusion...",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1100_10": "I was thinking of separating them with a\nmachine I got from Colress, but I guess\nthey’re OK!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1200_10": "You had your Pokémon’s best interest in\nmind.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1300_10": "Perhaps at first, their relationship really was\none-sided, like you imagined...",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1400_10": "but I think relationships are always changing.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1500_10": "Maybe the days they’ve spent together\nhelped them open up to each other and\ndeepened their bond, little by little.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1600_10": "I guess the relationship between Pokémon\nthat’ve fused is kind of like that of a\nsync pair, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1700_10": "I suppose you could put it that way. And\nof course...",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1800_10": "I’m sure forming a sync pair with Selene\nwas a positive influence on them, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_1900_10": "You really think so?",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_2000_10": "I wonder if we can become even better\nfriends—to the point where I can understand\nwhat it’s saying, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_0301_2100_10": "You can do it, Selene!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_0401_2200_10": "Yeah! Believe in yourself!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_0302_2300_10": "I think you’re good friends already!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_0402_2400_10": "Indeed. And it’s OK not to think about it\ntoo hard.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_0402_2500_10": "As long as you keep trying to understand\nyour partner, I’m sure you’ll be fine.",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_2600_10": "Awesome! Thanks, everyone!",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_2700_10": "I want us to shine even brighter as a\nsync pair...",
    "charaepi_ch0123_90_mizuki/2301_1201_2800_10": "so Necrozma and I will keep on battling\ntogether at full power!"
