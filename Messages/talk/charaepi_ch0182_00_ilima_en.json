    "charaepi_ch0182_00_ilima/2301_1201_0500_10": "Ever since I arrived on Pasio, I’ve been exploring\nnew battle strategies especially suited for\nsync pairs.",
    "charaepi_ch0182_00_ilima/2301_1201_0600_10": "When battling as a team, it’s important to\nposition yourself well so you don’t interfere\nwith your allies.",
