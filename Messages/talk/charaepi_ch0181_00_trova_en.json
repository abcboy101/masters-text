    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_0200_10": "Hello, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_0300_10": "Look at these flowers Florges and I have been\nlooking after!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0301_0400_10": "They’re beautiful!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0401_0500_10": "Right? Florges really knows how to take good care\nof them!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0302_0600_10": "Florges also looks after them?",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0402_0700_10": "That’s right! She loves flowers!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_0800_10": "Florges looks really energetic when she’s taking\ncare of flowers, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_0900_10": "Ooh, you both have a great eye for detail,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ], Elio.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1000_10": "I agree, and I’m happy that you both noticed!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1100_10": "Florges actually gets its energy from\nflowering plants.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1200_10": "And it’s said to devote its long life to protecting\nthe flower gardens it claims as its territory.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1300_10": "Cool! So that means Florges and the flowers are\nhelping each other out!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1400_10": "I did notice a lot of Flabébé at Melemele Meadow\nback in Alola. Huh...it makes sense now.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1500_10": "I gotta say, you’ve been studying a lot, Trevor!\nWell done!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1600_10": "Oh! Um... No, no—I still need to study a\nlot more...",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1700_10": "But thank you, Professor Kukui, for your\nkind words!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1800_10": "I’m also impressed, Trevor! You explained so well\nabout Florges—you’re just as smart as a\nRotom Dex!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_1900_10": "Wait...you’ve used a Rotom Dex before, Elio?!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2000_10": "Ah, I’m so jealous! I’ve only heard of it and have\nnever had the chance to get my hands on one!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2100_10": "Oh, right. Is the Rotom Dex somewhat difficult to\ncome by, Professor Kukui?",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2200_10": "Yeah, I’d say it’s pretty rare for a Trainer to\nhave one!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2300_10": "Oh, but I heard Clemont—a Gym Leader from\nKalos—was involved in developing it.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2400_10": "So, if you want to learn more about it, you should\nreach out to him!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2500_10": "Oh, really? Sure, I’ll ask him the next time I\nsee him!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2600_10": "The Rotom Dex is just amazing...",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2700_10": "Our tools and devices are updated day by day...\nTo put it another way, they evolve just like\nPokémon do.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2800_10": "Um...you know, someday I want to help update\na Pokédex.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_2900_10": "So, I’ve been writing reports based on my\nobservations of Pokémon I meet on Pasio, hoping\nto discover something new about them.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_3000_10": "I’ve also been writing reports about the battles I\nhave with different sync pairs.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0301_3100_10": "Wow, you’ve been researching a lot!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0401_3200_10": "Hehe! Well, I just really like what I do!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0302_3300_10": "I need to follow your example!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_0402_3400_10": "Oh, well, actually, I always follow YOU as an\nexample, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_3500_10": "Lately, I’ve been enjoying discovering new things\nand meeting all kinds of Pokémon from different\nregions.",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_3600_10": "I want to deepen my learning on Pasio and know\neven more about Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0181_00_trova/2301_1201_3700_10": "so that I can build a stronger connection with\nFlorges as a sync pair!"
