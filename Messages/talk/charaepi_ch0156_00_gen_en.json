    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_0200_10": "Oh, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. What brings you\nhere?",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0301_0300_10": "I came here to train!",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0401_0400_10": "Haha, I see you’re full of energy.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0401_0500_10": "Glad to see another sync pair working hard at\ntheir training!",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0302_0600_10": "I just felt like coming here.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0402_0700_10": "That might mean you have the ability to\nsense auras.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0402_0800_10": "Maybe you were drawn here because you sensed\nLucario’s aura...",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_0900_10": "The environment here is similar to a place in\nSinnoh called Iron Island.\n",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1000_10": "Lucario and I always used to train there.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1100_10": "Perhaps that’s why I was led to Pasio by some\nmysterious power...",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1200_10": "In any case, I always seem to find myself coming\nto this place.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1300_10": "Honestly, it’s become a part of my daily routine.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1400_10": "There are a lot of sync pairs on Pasio with strong\nauras.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1500_10": "I have to train harder so I don’t lose to them.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1600_10": "Lucario seems up for it.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1700_10": "Have I told you about auras before?",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1800_10": "An aura is essentially a vibration that emanates\nfrom one’s heart or soul.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_1900_10": "You could say it expresses a person’s strength.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2000_10": "Lucario can sense auras from far away.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2100_10": "It can also sense the opponent’s feelings or read\ntheir thoughts.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2200_10": "I can also read auras, though not as adeptly as\nLucario.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2300_10": "We’re both deeply interested in your aura,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0301_2400_10": "Mine?",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0401_2500_10": "You seem puzzled.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0302_2600_10": "What’s my aura like?",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_0402_2700_10": "It’s...loud, and makes me want to learn more\nabout what kind of Trainer you are.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2800_10": "By reading a person’s aura, I can tell what kind of\nheart they have.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_2900_10": "Your aura has yet to be imbued with anything.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3000_10": "It seems your heart is still developing—rocked by\nfeelings born from your endeavor to understand\nothers.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3100_10": "I think you have a very fascinating aura!",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3200_10": "This must be difficult to understand.",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3300_10": "If only you knew how to sense the auras of\nyourself and others...",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3400_10": "Actually, we’d be happy to train you!",
    "charaepi_ch0156_00_gen/2301_1201_3500_10": "If you could deepen your understanding of\nauras, that would make us happy!"
