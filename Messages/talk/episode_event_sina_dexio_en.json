    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_0400_10": "Eevee’s still shaking...",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_0500_10": "I couldn’t do anything to help him ’cause I’m\ntoo weak...",

    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_0700_10": "I wasn’t sure yet what Eevee was gonna\nevolve into.",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_0800_10": "But maybe I should have him evolve soon so he\ncan get stronger. Then he won’t be targeted\nas easily...",

    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_1000_10": "That’s right. Think carefully before you decide\nwhat to do.",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_1100_10": "In the same way Eevee has many potential\nEvolutions...",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_1200_10": "you two have endless potential as a sync pair.",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_1300_10": "You could become the strongest sync pair\non Pasio.",
    "episode_event_sina_dexio/4007_1001_1400_10": "Or Eevee could evolve into an unknown Pokémon\nno one has seen before.",
