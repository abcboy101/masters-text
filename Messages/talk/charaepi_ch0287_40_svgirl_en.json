    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0300_10": "And I learned a lot! Paldea Trainers sure\nare strong!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0400_10": "Heh heh... That’s quite the compliment!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0500_10": "We also discovered our partner Pokémon\nhave something in common!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0600_10": "True!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0700_10": "Just like how my Terapagos is strongly linked\nto the Terastal phenomenon...",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0800_10": "Leon’s Eternatus is deeply connected to\nDynamax!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_0900_10": "Both our Pokémon are full of mysteries.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1000_10": "Terapagos and I met in the deepest part of\nArea Zero.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1100_10": "An Area Zero explorer from long ago left\nbehind records mentioning it.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1200_10": "They called it a “Disk Pokémon.”",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1300_10": "But they didn’t say anything specific. So other\nthan his seemingly deep connection to\nTerastallization, Terapagos is an enigma.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1400_10": "I’ve been hoping to learn something by\nbecoming better friends with him, but...",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1500_10": "Hey, I’m sure you will! He’s your partner\nPokémon, after all, and you understand\neach other well!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1600_10": "I’m also hoping to learn more about\nEternatus!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1700_10": "Yeah!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_1800_10": "I’m really fond of Terapagos, you know.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_0301_1900_10": "He’s a special Pokémon, huh!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_0401_2000_10": "Yeah! Terapagos has already given me some\ngreat memories!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_0302_2100_10": "What makes him special?",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_0402_2200_10": "Well, the thing about Terapagos is...",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2300_10": "I was only able to catch him with the help of\nKieran and Carmine, who came to\ninvestigate and battle him with me.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2400_10": "For me, that memory is precious!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2500_10": "I know what you mean. These Pokémon may\nbe mysterious and Legendary, but that alone\nisn’t what makes them special.",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2600_10": "No matter the Pokémon, as you spend time\nwith it...",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2700_10": "you’ll create special memories together—\nones you’ll share forever!",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2800_10": "Yup! That’s why, just like with any other\nPokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0287_40_svgirl/2301_1201_2900_10": "I know I can become good friends with\nTerapagos, too!"
