    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0300_10": "You always have so much energy, Iris!\nYou’re just amazing!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0400_10": "You’re athletic, and you even do well in\nschool. I’m kind of jealous you’re so good\nat everything!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0500_10": "Stop—you’re gonna make me blush!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0600_10": "I wonder if exercise sharpens your\nbrain, too.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0700_10": "Hmmm. I wonder! I’ve never thought\nabout it.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0800_10": "Back in Unova, I was always good at\nexercising, even before I started studying!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_0900_10": "Maybe it’s ’cause I spent so much time\nplaying with Pokémon back in the Village\nof Dragons.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_1000_10": "That makes sense!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_1100_10": "Oh, you know what?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_1200_10": "Lately, I’ve been sparring with my Pokémon,\njust like Drayden does!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_1300_10": "Maybe that’s also made me stronger?",

    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8301_1001_1500_10": "I don’t think there are any students here who\ncould match your athleticism, Iris!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0100_10": "Oh!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0200_10": "Thou art able to fix not only thine own\nclothes but also those of others?!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0300_10": "Yeah... Damaged clothes bother me, so it’s\nhard to ignore.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0400_10": "I make a point of fixing anything I notice\nright then and there.",

    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0600_10": "But with such skill, why dost thou not add\nmore flair to thine own uniform?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0700_10": "More...flair?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0800_10": "Nah. I appreciate the idea, but that’s not\nreally my thing.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_0900_10": "If I wore anything too extreme, I might stand\nout—in a bad way.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1000_10": "I’d rather blend in with the other students,\nwhile keeping a comfortable distance.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1100_10": "That mindset is common among ninja!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1200_10": "Shouldst thou be hesitant to alter thy attire,\nthou mayest find ninja interesting!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1300_10": "I would be more than honored to hold a\nlecture on their ways.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1400_10": "Ninja, huh.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8302_1001_1500_10": "Yeah. That’s not a bad idea.",

    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0200_10": "Are you gonna teach here or something?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0300_10": "Well, I was also asked to do that, yes,\nbut I’m here for the same reason you are,\nBrendan.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0400_10": "To broaden my knowledge and learn\nnew things!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0500_10": "What?! Y-you mean you’re a student,\nlike me?!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0600_10": "Sure am! Age and experience don’t matter\nwhen it comes to learning!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0700_10": "Studying is a lifelong endeavor. Even as\nan adult!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0800_10": "Wow... Even as an adult?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_0900_10": "Wait, if you’re a student...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_1000_10": "then you’ll be classmates with older students\nand members of the Elite Four, like Drake\nand Glacia.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_1100_10": "And you’ll share notes and join clubs with\nthem, too?!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_1200_10": "Hahaha! I certainly could!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_1300_10": "I can’t even imagine...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8303_1001_1400_10": "As a family, we should thank Pasio Academy\nfor such a rare opportunity!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0100_10": "We should have a school song!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0200_10": "I wanna make one just like the one we had\nat the academy in Paldea.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0300_10": "That’s my goal! I wanna make it happen\none day!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0400_10": "Yeah! That’d be great!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0500_10": "Singing along with your classmates is all\npart of the student experience, y’know?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0600_10": "Right?! Plus, you need one for school events!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0700_10": "If we make one for Pasio Academy, it should\nbe something ANYONE will want to sing,\nno matter their age!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0800_10": "Totally! If we students have a hand in\nmaking it, it’ll be perfect for our school!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_0900_10": "We have a lot of famous musicians here on\nPasio...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1000_10": "I’m sure it’d be fun if we got them involved!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1100_10": "I want it to be super cute!",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1200_10": "A cute song...or a cool song...",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1300_10": "To each their own, I guess. Seems it’d be\nhard to please everyone.",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1400_10": "What if we made a Pasio Academy song\ncommittee?",
    "episode_event_academy_summer02/8304_1001_1500_10": "Any student who wants to could join. \nIt could become a precious memory!"
