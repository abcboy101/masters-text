    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0200_10": "Hello everyone! Thank you for coming!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0300_10": "Today, I’ll be presenting my research on the\nmysterious stones discovered on Pasio!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0400_10": "To start, the official name of these stones has\nbeen decided.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0500_10": "They will be called...\"sync stones ultimate\"!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0600_10": "I chose this name because there’s a high\nprobability these stones contain more power\nthan ordinary sync stones.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0700_10": "Much like sync stones, these stones react to the\nbond between people and Pokémon, emitting\nradiant energy.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0800_10": "But at the moment, extracting 100% of the power\ncontained in these stones proves challenging, even\nwith the best sync pairs.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_0900_10": "It’s also very difficult to embed the stones into\nPoryphones, and it may take a little longer for\neveryone to be able to use them.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_1000_10": "Nevertheless, these stones hold new possibilities\nthat may strengthen the power and bonds of\nsync pairs.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_1100_10": "So allow us to showcase a snippet of the current\nfindings from our research!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_1200_10": "I’ll now turn the presentation over to\n[Name:PlayerNickname ] and Pikachu!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_0301_1300_10": "Talk to Pikachu.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_0401_1400_10": "... ... ...",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_0302_1500_10": "Take a deep breath.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_0402_1600_10": "... ... ...",

    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_2000_10": "Show me thy bond.",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_2100_10": "Huh?!",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_2200_10": "That voice...",
    "story_stone_05_02000/2401_1201_2300_10": "Was that—?!"
