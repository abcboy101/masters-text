    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_0600_10": "Oh, that’s right!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_0700_10": "I was having so much fun battling\nwith you and Jigglypuff—I got\ncarried away!",

    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1000_10": "According to this paranormal magazine in Paldea,\nit looks like a Jigglypuff from a billion years ago!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1100_10": "I can kinda see it! It looks like a slightly more\nferocious version of a regular Jigglypuff,\ndon’t you think?",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1200_10": "A billion years ago, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1300_10": "Isn’t that way before the era when Fossil Pokémon\nwere flourishing?",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1400_10": "Well, the magazine might’ve been exaggerating\na little.",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1500_10": "I’ve been so curious to know whether that story is\ntrue, though!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_1600_10": "So I thought a battle with Lyra’s Jigglypuff might\nbe a good way to compare the two!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0301_1700_10": "Wouldn’t you have battled even if\nthey weren’t similar?",

    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0401_1900_10": "I guess I would’ve either way... Heh!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0302_2000_10": "Was that the only reason?",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0402_2100_10": "Umm...",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0402_2200_10": "To be honest with you... I think I just really\nwanted to have a battle!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2300_10": "Besides, whether that magazine story is true or\nnot...",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2400_10": "Scream Tail is apparently categorized as a\nParadox Pokémon, and it came here from a\ncompletely different era!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2500_10": "I’m SO happy to be able to battle as a sync pair\nwith a Pokémon we have so much to learn about!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2600_10": "There are lots of other Pokémon on Pasio that are\nfull of mysteries too, like Ultra Beasts...",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2700_10": "And there are Trainers out who can fully connect\nwith them! I’ve gotta keep up!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2800_10": "Pokémon are still Pokémon, no matter where\nthey’re from...or when!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_2900_10": "I wanna work hard so I can become an amazing\nsync pair with Scream Tail!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_3000_10": "I think Scream Tail is happy to be your partner\nPokémon, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_3100_10": "It got to meet a Trainer who accepts it just the\nway it is!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0301_3200_10": "I hope you two become a great\nsync pair!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0401_3300_10": "Uh-huh! We’re totally gonna take our connection\nto the next level!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0302_3400_10": "You two make a ferocious sync pair!",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_0402_3500_10": "Haha! Scream Tail seems to like battling too, so\nI guess we’re pretty similar?",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_3600_10": "Maybe other Pokémon from a different time will\ncome to Pasio.",
    "charaepi_ch0289_10_nemo/2301_1201_3700_10": "If that ever happens, I hope they’ll see us and feel\ninspired to become partner Pokémon, too!",
