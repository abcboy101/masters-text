    "ch0171_00_shijima/0101_0701_02_10": "Now that you’re here, let’s get straight to training!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7101_0701_01_10": "Training under a pounding waterfall is great!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7101_0701_02_10": "The cold water can’t be beat, especially on hot\ndays!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7101_0701_03_10": "If you like, I can teach you how to do waterfall\ntraining sometime!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7102_0701_01_10": "Wahahah! Glad to see you looking energetic today!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7102_0701_02_10": "If you don’t have energy, you can’t train!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7102_0701_03_10": "And if you can’t train, you can’t get strong!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7103_0701_01_10": "My Pokémon are a little— No, more than a little\ndifferent from ordinary!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7103_0701_02_10": "They test their strength against each other to\ntrain themselves!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7103_0701_03_10": "’Cause they love training just as much as I do!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7104_0701_01_10": "Wahahah! What do you think of these muscles?!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7104_0701_02_10": "After training them under a pounding waterfall\nday after day, my muscles can crush boulders!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7104_0701_03_10": "That really has nothing to do with Pokémon battles,\nthough! Wahahah!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7105_0701_01_10": "[Name:PlayerNickname ]! You’ve got a lot of\npotential!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7105_0701_02_10": "If you keep training hard, you could even become\nstrong enough to crush boulders, just like me!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7105_0701_03_10": "...What? That has nothing to do with Pokémon?",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7105_0701_04_10": "That’s true! But you can never go wrong by\ngetting stronger!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/7105_0701_05_10": "For example, uh... I know! You can open jars,\neven if the lid’s stuck really tight!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/1701_0701_01_10": "I’ve got a gift for you! Here, take it!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/1701_0702_01_10": "Get out there and give it your all, youngster!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2501_0701_01_10": "The sweets I eat between training sessions are\nalways the best.",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2501_0701_02_10": "It seems like the more I work out, the more my\nbody craves sugar!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2501_0701_03_10": "The sweets are a reward to myself, but because\nof them, this belly just won’t get any flatter, no\nmatter how much I train! Wahahah!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2501_0702_01_10": "Hey! I bet you’re wondering about those post-\ntraining sweets now too, aren’t you?",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2501_0702_02_10": "If you want to enjoy those sweets to the fullest,\nwhy don’t you train along with me?!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0701_01_10": "Of course it’s important to work out and train\nyour body...",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0701_02_10": "because putting in that effort every day helps to\nboost your self-confidence!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0701_03_10": "And that’s the most important thing of all! There’s\nno point in battling if you’ve already lost inside\nyour own head.",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0702_01_10": "Anyway, the first thing you’ve got to do is believe\nin yourself!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0702_02_10": "If you keep doing anything consistently, even if it’s\nsmall, it’ll make you more confident! I promise!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/2511_0702_03_10": "The best thing to do is just keep doing whatever\nyou’re doing, and don’t stop halfway through!\nWahahah!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/3001_0701_01_10": "Yo! I work out hard from the crack of dawn! I love\nto train under a waterfall and clear my head!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/3003_0701_01_10": "On Pasio, you can find the best sweets from\neverywhere! I just loooove eating them with\nmy lunch!",
    "ch0171_00_shijima/3005_0701_01_10": "At night, I think of my dear wife... I’m sure she’s\ndoing OK. She’s always been tough!"
