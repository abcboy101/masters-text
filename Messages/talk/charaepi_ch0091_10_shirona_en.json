    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0301_0300_10": "Taking a rest?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0401_0400_10": "This is part of my training.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0302_0500_10": "What are you doing?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0402_0600_10": "I’m training. Heh heh, did you think I was just\ntaking a rest?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_0700_10": "I face Lucario with a clear mind in order to train\nmentally, in addition to working on my strength\nand moves.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_0800_10": "Lucario is able to sense the auras of all things\nand can read his opponents’ thoughts.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_0900_10": "Of course, I could never hope to attain that mental\nstate myself...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1000_10": "But if I train mentally and concentrate during\nbattle, I might be able to understand at least\nsome of my opponents’ thoughts and goals...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1100_10": "So that’s why I’m training like this.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1200_10": "I just hope it can bring me even one step closer to\nLucario, who can freely manipulate auras.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1300_10": "I’ll admit, though, that when we first met, I really\nstruggled with those auras.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1400_10": "But now Lucario and I have known each other\nfor quite a long time.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1500_10": "Ever since... Yes, I was still a new Trainer\ntraveling around the Sinnoh region.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1600_10": "Lucario was still Riolu at the time.",

    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1800_10": "It was pretty difficult to become close at first,\nbecause he could see right through to the very\ndepths of my heart.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_1900_10": "Since he could see even my greatest flaws...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2000_10": "I felt vulnerable and ashamed.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2100_10": "But...as our bond grew and he evolved\ninto Lucario...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2200_10": "I started to view that as our greatest weapon.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2300_10": "Even knowing every last secret within my heart\nand mind...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2400_10": "Lucario is still willing to help me and battle by my\nside. I can’t imagine a more reliable partner.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2500_10": "During our travels through Sinnoh, and when we\nvisited other regions afterward...",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2600_10": "Lucario and I faced all manner of challengers—\nand together, we were victorious!",

    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_2800_10": "Lucario will always be my dear, precious partner.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0301_2900_10": "Is he saying he feels the same?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0401_3000_10": "Yes, I think he probably is.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0302_3100_10": "Is he saying he knows you mean it?",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_0402_3200_10": "I’m sure he is.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_3300_10": "Lucario can always tell if someone is lying.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_3400_10": "But it’s not just Lucario who can do that.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_3500_10": "If you lie to a Pokémon, it’ll always see right\nthrough you.",
    "charaepi_ch0091_10_shirona/2301_1201_3600_10": "So whenever you interact with a Pokémon, don’t\nforget to face it honestly and openly—and to\nshow it how much you love it!"
