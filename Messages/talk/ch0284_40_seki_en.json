    "ch0284_40_seki/0101_0701_02_10": "Come on! Let’s go liven up the dance floor!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7101_0701_01_10": "This dance garb sure is, uh...modern, huh? I like it!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7101_0701_02_10": "I wish I could give outfits like this to the rest of the\nDiamond Clan, too...",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7101_0701_03_10": "I can think of a guy this would really look\ngood on.",

    "ch0284_40_seki/7102_0701_02_10": "Or at least it did back in Hisui.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7102_0701_03_10": "I’m not sure why the flow of time changed all\nthat...",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7103_0701_01_10": "Time sure flies in this era.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7103_0701_02_10": "Information spreads in the blink of an eye, and\nthe world keeps on changing.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7103_0701_03_10": "It’s exciting to watch unfold but pretty tough to\nkeep up with!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7104_0701_01_10": "Nature has its own kind of music, you know—and\nit’s pretty good!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7104_0701_02_10": "The sound of wind, the cries of Pokémon echoing\nthrough the air...",
    "ch0284_40_seki/7104_0701_03_10": "Try listening for its little melodies yourself\nsometime—you can hear them anywhere!",

    "ch0284_40_seki/2501_0701_01_10": "The dances of this era are certainly different from\nany of the ones I know.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2501_0701_02_10": "The speed—or maybe tempo?—is like nothing I’ve\never seen.",

    "ch0284_40_seki/2501_0702_01_10": "The dances of the future might be even faster\nthan the ones from this era...",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2501_0702_02_10": "That’s an exciting thought—people pushing the\nspeed of dance to the limit!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2511_0701_01_10": "Ursaluna seemed about as taken aback by this\nera as I was.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2511_0701_02_10": "It’s taken some time, but I think he’s gotten used\nto it.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2511_0701_03_10": "Me, on the other hand...I’m still trying to catch up.",
    "ch0284_40_seki/2511_0702_01_10": "If you really think about it, Pokémon and humans\nhave a lot in common.",

    "ch0284_40_seki/3001_0701_01_10": "Waking up early is great! It’s an effective use of\nyour time, and the early bird catches the worm!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/3003_0701_01_10": "Right, let’s do what we have to while the sun’s\nstill out!",
    "ch0284_40_seki/3005_0701_01_10": "Is that the time already? Time flies so quickly..."
