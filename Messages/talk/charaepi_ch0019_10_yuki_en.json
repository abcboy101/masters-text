    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_0300_10": "Pasio is a nice place, but for Latios, it’s a pretty\ndramatic change in environment.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_0400_10": "That’s why I wanna do anything I can for him!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_0500_10": "In order to do that, I want to know more\nabout Latios.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_0600_10": "Especially because of what happened before...",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_0301_0700_10": "What happened before?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_0401_0800_10": "Well... Y’see, I thought Latios was a Pokémon that\ndoesn’t like to fight...",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_0302_0900_10": "Did something happen?",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_0402_1000_10": "Yeah. There was a small incident...",

    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_2000_10": "It’s a Pokémon that knows when it’s the right time\nto fight!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_2100_10": "Ever since then, I borrow his strength without \nhesitation when it’s the right time to fight.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_0301_2200_10": "That’s wonderful!",

    "charaepi_ch0019_10_yuki/2301_1201_2600_10": "By the way... Change of subject, but there’s a\nrumor that blue and red Pokémon have been\nspotted flying around different regions.",
