    "episode_event_academy_winter/4001_1001_0300_10": "But lately, I’ve found drawing itself to\nbe fun!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4001_1001_0400_10": "So now I’ve become a bit more critical\nof my work.",

    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_0800_10": "Hmm... I am no teacher, so no need\nfor such esteem.",

    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_1500_10": "At the end of this lesson, I’d like\nall of you to show me your art!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_1600_10": "I look forward to seeing what your\neye for beauty produces.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_1700_10": "All right! I’ve gotta draw something\nI can be proud of!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_1800_10": "Oooh, everyone’s having fun drawing!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_1900_10": "We should join in!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2000_10": "Hmm... That student over there...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2100_10": "Hm... It’s still not right...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2200_10": "It’s about time to wrap up!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2300_10": "OK, everyone. What did you draw?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2400_10": "... ... ...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2500_10": "It’s time to present our drawings!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2600_10": "What?!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2700_10": "U-um! Could I...not?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2800_10": "Oh? Why?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_2900_10": "It may be a little awkward at first,\nbut it’s the fastest way to improve!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_3000_10": "Knowing someone will see your work\ncan help you better your skills.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_3100_10": "But...I didn’t have enough time,\nand it’s not even complete...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_3200_10": "Not avant-garde! You are mistaken!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4003_1001_3300_10": "B-Brassius?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0100_10": "Kris! Just because a work of art is\nincomplete doesn’t mean you can’t\ndisplay it!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0200_10": "I understand the pain and the\nstruggle—of being unhappy with your\nwork but having to show it to others!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0300_10": "But your time this lesson was limited!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0400_10": "This assignment had a deadline!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0500_10": "Sometimes speed is critical! If you’re\nunable to finish in a certain time,\nthat’s simply your limit as an artist.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0600_10": "Oh...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0700_10": "Why do you hang your head?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0800_10": "It is not a criticism.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_0900_10": "Huh?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1000_10": "Today’s deadline was for this\nlesson only!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1100_10": "It is the artist who decides whether\ntheir work is complete!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1200_10": "Some pieces are done in a matter of\nseconds!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1300_10": "But others may never be—even if the\nartist spends their whole life on it!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1400_10": "Thus, if you feel your art is\nincomplete...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1500_10": "then keep going! Spend all the time\nyou need until YOU say it’s complete!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1600_10": "... ... ...!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1700_10": "That said, you set your expectations\nfar too high!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1800_10": "You love Pokémon so much, your\nvision surpasses your ability!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_1900_10": "Oh...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2000_10": "So keep learning! And hone your eye\nfor beauty!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2100_10": "That is why schools and teachers\nexist!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2200_10": "Right, Hass?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2300_10": "Indeed, Brassie!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2400_10": "You can come to me about art\nanytime—not just during class.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2500_10": "OK! I’ll keep at it!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2600_10": "*sob*",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2700_10": "Dear Brassie! You’ve given my\nstudents such a wonderful lesson...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2800_10": "THANGYU SO MUBCH!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_2900_10": "BWUUUH huh huh hoi hoi!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3000_10": "You knew from the beginning,\ndidn’t you, Hass.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3100_10": "You realized Kris was in a slump,\njust like I once was.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3200_10": "Yes, but I knew you’d be a good\ninfluence, Brassie.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3300_10": "I truly believe that teaching,\nmy chosen profession, is what\nI was born to do.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3400_10": "And as for you, Brassie...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3500_10": "Taking on the responsibility for such\nyoung, budding lives... It is still a\nweight I could not bear.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3600_10": "But...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4004_1001_3700_10": "If it’s a request from you, Hass,\nI suppose I can’t decline.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1101_0100_20": "Days later...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0200_10": "Avant-garde! The ink you’ve used\ngives your work depth!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0300_10": "Thank you! I guess handwriting all those\nPokédex entries finally paid off!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0400_10": "This painting roars like a dragon!\nYour style is dynamic!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0500_10": "I can tell you have a passion for\nPokémon!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0600_10": "Hehehe! I’m glad my love of dragon\nPokémon comes through!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0700_10": "I see... Everyone has their own way of\nexpressing themselves.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0800_10": "Kris! How go your art studies?",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_0900_10": "Well, I’ve been challenging myself to\ndraw all sorts of things.",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1000_10": "And I’m still adding to that sketch\nI was working on before!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1100_10": "It’s getting closer and closer to what\nI’d imagined!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1200_10": "It’s, um...right here...",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1300_10": "Oh! It’s coming together!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1400_10": "That said, your expression is stiff!\nTry breaking out of your shell!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1500_10": "Yes, sir!",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1600_10": "(Young sprouts truly do grow with\nastounding speed, yes...)",
    "episode_event_academy_winter/4005_1001_1700_10": "(Teaching is such a fascinating job!)"
