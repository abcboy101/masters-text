    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_0300_10": "I hear you’re looking for Looker Tickets, too,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_0400_10": "Y’know, the ones you find for that training\ncourse, “The Looker Method: Yes, even YOU can\nbecome a detective in five easy steps!”",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0301_0500_10": "Yep!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0401_0600_10": "I knew it!",

    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_0900_10": "For this training, we’ve got to find the five\nLooker Tickets that are hidden all over town.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1000_10": "This is apparently a training method Looker himself\nused back in the day when he was a detective.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1100_10": "Word is it’s also great for building your bond as a\nsync pair, so it’s pretty popular.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1200_10": "I know! Why don’t we work together to find the\nremaining tickets?",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1101_1300_20": "[Name:PlayerNickname ] teamed up with Hop,\nand together, they found all five Looker Tickets!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1400_10": "Here you go! Look, we found ’em all!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1500_10": "Indeed you have!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_1600_10": "But tell me, did you two work together to\nfind them?",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0301_1700_10": "Yup!",

    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0402_2000_10": "Hm... I see!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2100_10": "Oh... Were we not supposed to do that?",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2200_10": "No, you’re quite welcome to! In fact, I’m happy\nthat you did!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2300_10": "Working together is one thing that makes you a\ngood detective! It’s also the key to becoming a\ngood sync pair, too!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2400_10": "In fact, this Croagunk of mine helps me on\na daily basis! Any help your friends and\npartners can give you is a huge asset!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2500_10": "Just be careful not to leave all the work to\nothers!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_2600_10": "It’s all about how you use that connection...\nJust like how Croagunk’s poison can be used\nfor medicinal purposes.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0301_2700_10": "I see!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0401_2800_10": "The person who uses the poison is the one who\ndecides whether it’s used to help or hurt others!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0302_2900_10": "Oh, that’s interesting!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_0402_3000_10": "It sure is! The world is complicated, but that’s\nwhat makes it interesting!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3100_10": "That’s why our job is to watch out for those who\nmight use those things to hurt others.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3200_10": "We’ve got to protect people and Pokémon\nfrom villains!",

    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3400_10": "Thanks! I’m glad to hear you think so!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3500_10": "My job is the type that’s always skirting the line\nof danger. To be honest, I’ve found it tough to\ndeal with from time to time...",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3600_10": "But it’s even worse to think of the people and\nPokémon who suffer at the hands of evildoers!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3700_10": "After all, precious Pokémon lives have been lost to\nfolks like that...",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3800_10": "Looker...",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_3900_10": "Oh! Sorry, that was quite a heavy topic, wasn’t it.",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_4000_10": "Anyhow, before I forget, here’s your gift for\nfinding all five Looker Tickets!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_4100_10": "You can use that to get a meal at any of the\nfine restaurants on this island!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_4200_10": "Wow! I can’t wait to use this!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_4300_10": "Youngsters like you should eat up so you have\nthe energy to always do your best!",
    "charaepi_ch0217_00_handsome/2301_1201_4400_10": "That’s what helps reduce the number of people\nand Pokémon who have to suffer at the hands of\nnasty evildoers!"
