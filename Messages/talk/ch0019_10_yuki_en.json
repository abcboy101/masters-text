    "ch0019_10_yuki/0101_0701_02_10": "If you’ve ever got a problem, you can always\ncome talk to me!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7101_0701_01_10": "Hey, what do you think of this sygna suit?\nPersonally, I love it! It’s so cool and stylish!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7101_0701_02_10": "May even said it was a fresh new look for me\nsince I’m not wearing a hat!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7102_0701_01_10": "Latios has the ability to make people see images\nof what it has seen or imagines in its head.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7102_0701_02_10": "But my Latios is actually kinda shy.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7102_0701_03_10": "Earlier he was acting so fidgety, I was wondering\nwhat was up...",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7102_0701_04_10": "And it turned out he just wanted to tell me he was\nhungry! Isn’t that cute?",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7103_0701_01_10": "Apparently Latios doesn’t really like fighting.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7103_0701_02_10": "I think that’s one of Latios’s strengths, actually.\nHe doesn’t battle for no reason.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7103_0701_03_10": "I tend to rush straight into things myself, so the\ntwo of us are a perfectly balanced team!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7104_0701_01_10": "Latios has been with me since we traveled around\nHoenn together.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7104_0701_02_10": "So I know his skills and strengths better\nthan anyone!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7104_0701_03_10": "But when I told him that, he almost seemed\nto blush!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7105_0701_01_10": "Is there anywhere you want to go,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]? Latios and I can\ntake you!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7105_0701_02_10": "Just about anywhere’s only a quick flight away if\nwe ride on Latios’s back!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7105_0701_03_10": "You do have to be careful, though. Sometimes\nLatios has so much fun flying, he gets a bit\ncarried away.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/7105_0701_04_10": "Then he’ll speed up so fast, he sends nearby\nPelipper spinning in his wake!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! Here, this is for you!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/1701_0702_01_10": "Latios wanted to give you a present! Use it well!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2501_0701_01_10": "I went on a bike ride with May the other day.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2501_0701_02_10": "My Latios was really happy that May brought\nher Latias along with her.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2501_0701_03_10": "While May and I were cycling, Latios and Latias\nwere flying in happy circles above us.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2501_0702_01_10": "I’ve made a lot of new friends since coming\nto Pasio.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2501_0702_02_10": "But it’s just as important to spend quality time with\nold friends, too.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0701_01_10": "Apparently Latios will only become friendly with\nthose who have a compassionate spirit.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0701_02_10": "So I guess that must mean I’ve got a\ncompassionate spirit, right?",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0701_03_10": "Haha... I’m trying not to blush!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0702_01_10": "I’m pretty sure there’s an awful lot of\ncompassionate Trainers in the world.",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0702_02_10": "But Latios chose me!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/2511_0702_03_10": "I’m so happy about that—and proud, too!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/3001_0701_01_10": "Me and my dad are gonna do some training\ntogether today. Wanna come? We can help\neach other get stronger!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/3003_0701_01_10": "I used to daydream about drifting through the\nsky like a cloud... But did you know that clouds\nactually move super fast?!",
    "ch0019_10_yuki/3005_0701_01_10": "Phew... I think I’m gonna call it a day soon.\nTime to rest up and get ready for more\nadventures tomorrow!"
