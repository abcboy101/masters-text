    "ch0123_40_mizuki/0101_0701_02_10": "Let’s do our best to keep smiles on everyone’s\nfaces!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7101_0701_01_10": "It’s a hero’s job to get the show’s audience all\nfired up!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7101_0701_02_10": "I’m not sure I can do as good a job of it as the\nMasked Royal...",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7101_0701_03_10": "but I’ll be performing as hard as I can, so\nhopefully the guests’ll have fun!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7102_0701_01_10": "Scizor’s steel pincers can crush anything into bits,\nno matter how hard it is!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7102_0701_02_10": "That’s why I’m sure we as a sync pair can crush\nany bad guys we take on!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7103_0701_01_10": "Hey, guess what?! I thought of something that could\nreally entertain the crowd at the show! Wanna\nhear?!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7103_0701_02_10": "We could have the heroes make a dramatic\nentrance by arriving on Ride Pokémon!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7103_0701_03_10": "And not just on land—from the sea or the sky\ntoo!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7103_0701_04_10": "What do you think? Isn’t that a great idea?",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7104_0701_01_10": "Every hero’s gotta have a catchphrase!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7104_0701_02_10": "For me, I guess it could be “Alola!”\n...Maybe?",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7104_0701_03_10": "That’s just my usual greeting, though, so it doesn’t\nreally have the impact I’m looking for. Can you\nthink of any other good lines?",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7105_0701_01_10": "You help the people around you all the time too,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7105_0701_02_10": "If you ask me, that definitely makes you a hero!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/7105_0701_03_10": "Let’s keep working hard to be good role models\nfor others!",

    "ch0123_40_mizuki/1701_0702_01_10": "Maybe it’ll even help you get out of a tight spot!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2501_0701_01_10": "Rosa told me Pokéstar Studios has lots of different\ngenres of films!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2501_0701_02_10": "And it sounds like they’ve made a lot of movies\nthat feature battling heroes, too—like “Invaders”\nand “Big Monster.”",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2501_0701_03_10": "Y’know, I bet I could do some pretty good acting\nnow!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2501_0702_01_10": "Even things that aren’t real can show up in\nmovies! Technology is amazing!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2501_0702_02_10": "Although...are we sure monsters and stuff like\nthat don’t really exist?",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2511_0701_01_10": "It’s so exciting and fun to act while fully immersing\nyourself in your character!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2511_0701_02_10": "...When I said that to Professor Kukui, he said he\ntotally got it!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2511_0701_03_10": "I wonder if he’s done some acting before, too.",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2511_0702_01_10": "I want to learn and experience so many more\nthings, so I can see lots of different sides of\nmyself!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/2511_0702_02_10": "Then I’ll be able to say “Alola!” to a new me I’ve\nnever met before!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/3001_0701_01_10": "It’s a perfect day for adventure! I sure hope we\nget to meet all sorts of interesting sync pairs!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/3003_0701_01_10": "Alola! That’s how we say “hi” in the Alola region!\nNow you try it! Go on!",
    "ch0123_40_mizuki/3005_0701_01_10": "I saw a shooting star a little while ago! Don’t\nworry—I made sure to wish for everybody to\nalways be happy!"
