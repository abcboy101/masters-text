    "ch0290_00_teru/7101_0701_01_10": "There aren’t any wild Pokémon on Pasio, right?",
    "ch0290_00_teru/7101_0701_02_10": "So what am I supposed to do as a member of\nthe Survey Corps?",
    "ch0290_00_teru/7101_0701_03_10": "I guess I’ll start by studying the Pokémon that\nTrainers on Pasio are partnered with.",

    "ch0290_00_teru/7105_0701_03_10": "I had no idea what was going on at first, but she\ntaught me everything I needed to know.",
    "ch0290_00_teru/7105_0701_04_10": "I’m so glad I met her!",
    "ch0290_00_teru/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! There’s something I want to\ngive you!",
    "ch0290_00_teru/1701_0702_01_10": "I’m sure it’ll come in handy!",

    "ch0290_00_teru/2501_0702_01_10": "The Arc Phone still has a lot of mysteries...",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2501_0702_02_10": "There are all sorts of people on Pasio. Maybe\nI’ll talk to someone who knows a lot about myths\nand technology sometime.",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0701_01_10": "Isn’t it nerve-racking to experience somewhere\nnew?",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0701_02_10": "When I first arrived in Hisui, I was really scared\nand unsure.",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0701_03_10": "But as it turned out, I learned a lot and got\nto meet all kinds of people.",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0701_04_10": "It’s not all that bad!",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0702_01_10": "When you’re somewhere that’s unfamiliar, it’s\ncomforting to have something that you already\nknow.",
    "ch0290_00_teru/2511_0702_02_10": "For me, that was Pokémon.",
