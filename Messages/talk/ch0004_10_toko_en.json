    "ch0004_10_toko/0101_0701_02_10": "Today, we’re gonna have the most intense battles\nPasio has ever seen!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7101_0701_01_10": "Victini is the Victory Pokémon! It’s perfect for me\nsince I love battling so much!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7101_0701_02_10": "But actually, I’m trying to be the one to give Victini\nthe present of victory!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7101_0701_03_10": "That’s what’s on my mind when we’re\nbattling together.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7102_0701_01_10": "I think it’s important to try everything—not just\nin battles but in anything you do!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7102_0701_02_10": "I’ve tried out the Pasio food-fighting challenge,\nthe Pasio cold-endurance challenge,\nthe Pasio speed-walking challenge...",

    "ch0004_10_toko/7103_0701_01_10": "So, what do you think of this sygna suit? It\nmatches Victini!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7103_0701_02_10": "Whenever I wear it, I can’t wait to find someone\nto battle!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7103_0701_03_10": "Oh, I was always like that? I guess you have\na point!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7104_0701_01_10": "All in all, it seems I’m most compatible with\nFire-type Pokémon.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7104_0701_02_10": "That doesn’t mean I only use Fire types, but\neverything just seems to click when I’m paired\nwith them!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7105_0701_01_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]. Do you have\nanyone you really don’t wanna lose to?",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7105_0701_02_10": "For me, it’s everyone! Though lately, I guess it’s\nyou in particular, [Name:PlayerNickname ].",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7105_0701_03_10": "Now that we’re even better friends, I feel like I\nunderstand you better.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/7105_0701_04_10": "I know how strong you are, so that’s probably\nwhy I don’t want to lose to you!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! Here, take this! It’s for you!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/1701_0702_01_10": "Victini found it, so maybe it has the power to\nbring you victory!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0701_01_10": "You know how you can make a V sign with\nyour fingers?",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0701_02_10": "I think people saw Victini doing that pose and\nstarted copying it!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0701_03_10": "I think it’s a pretty valid theory...but what do\nyou think?",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0702_01_10": "Victory starts with a V! Cool pose, right?",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0702_02_10": "Do you have a cool victory pose, too?",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2501_0702_03_10": "If you strike your favorite pose with your partner\nPokémon, it really pumps you up!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0701_01_10": "Ever since I paired up with Victini, I started\nthinking about what it means to win.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0701_02_10": "I don’t really have a solid answer yet, but...",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0701_03_10": "I think what you do to win is more important than\nactually winning.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0702_01_10": "Whether you win or lose, everything you did along\nthe way builds up and doesn’t change.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0702_02_10": "Calling it a win or a loss is just labeling a result.",
    "ch0004_10_toko/2511_0702_03_10": "Well... Even if it’s just a result, I really don’t\nwanna lose!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! C’mon, let’s get battling already!",
    "ch0004_10_toko/3003_0701_01_10": "Hey. Wanna team up for a few battles today?",
