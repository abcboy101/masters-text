    "ch0027_40_natane/0101_0701_02_10": "It’s time to pull up whatever’s anchoring our\nspirits and head out for the open sea!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7101_0701_01_10": "Check out my outfit! Something about it makes me\nfeel powerful and hungry for adventure.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7101_0701_02_10": "Honestly, I just want to be out searching for buried\ntreasure or something!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7102_0701_01_10": "Anchors aweigh! Yo-ho-ho!\n...Well? What do you think? Can I pull it off?",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7102_0701_02_10": "Apparently “anchors aweigh” is ship lingo that\nmeans the anchor has been hoisted and the\nvoyage can officially begin!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7102_0701_03_10": "It makes me feel powerful—maybe I’ll say that\nat the start of my next battle!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7103_0701_01_10": "The shining sun, the bright blue sky—I just love\nhot, clear days!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7103_0701_02_10": "Know why? Because I get to see Grass-type\nPokémon soaking it all up!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7103_0701_03_10": "Maybe next time I’ll take them all out on a ship so\nwe can cruise across the sea together!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7104_0701_01_10": "Some Grass-type Pokémon, like Dhelmise or Lotad,\nlive in the water.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7104_0701_02_10": "They’ve got a different kind of charm from the\nGrass-types who live on land...",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7104_0701_03_10": "I can kinda understand how people who love\nwater Pokémon feel.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7105_0701_01_10": "Uh...hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]? There’s\nnothing behind me...right?",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7105_0701_02_10": "I mean, of course there isn’t! I don’t see anything,\nso that must mean nothing’s there!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7105_0701_03_10": "Allister and Phoebe were staring really hard at\nsomething over my shoulder, though...",
    "ch0027_40_natane/7105_0701_04_10": "I’m sure I’m just overthinking things...right?",
    "ch0027_40_natane/1701_0701_01_10": "I found this on the beach...but you can have it!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/1701_0702_01_10": "I hope you find that treasure useful!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2501_0701_01_10": "Ever since I came to Pasio, I’ve been running into\nPokémon I’ve never seen before much more often.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2501_0701_02_10": "Every time I see a Grass-type Pokémon that looks\nlike a ghost, it always makes me jump!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2501_0701_03_10": "The same thing happened with Dhelmise. It’s cute,\nbut I’m still just a little bit scared of it...",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2501_0702_01_10": "Is there a Pokémon like that for you? One that’s a\nmix of your favorite and least favorite types?",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2501_0702_02_10": "Well hey, if there are, let’s try our best to warm\nup to them!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0701_01_10": "Back when Sinnoh was still called Hisui, the people\nwho lived there used to think Pokémon were\nterrifying creatures!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0701_02_10": "As terrifying as ghosts, even.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0701_03_10": "Maybe that’s because Pokémon weren’t very well\nunderstood back then.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0701_04_10": "I suppose if we learn more about ghosts the way\nwe did with Pokémon, they might become less\nfrightening.",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0702_01_10": "Oh, guess what! I heard that back in the Hisui\nregion, there was a person like me who knew a\nlot about plants!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0702_02_10": "Apparently they used to take care of their village’s\nfields, where the vegetables grew...",
    "ch0027_40_natane/2511_0702_03_10": "Maybe I’ll try growing my own vegetables, too!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/3001_0701_01_10": "Ahoy! Nice morning today, isn’t it? Breathing in the\nsea air can really help clear your mind!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/3003_0701_01_10": "Today’s weather is perfect for sailing! I’d love to\nhop on a ship and cruise around the island on a\nday like this!",
    "ch0027_40_natane/3005_0701_01_10": "Hey...we’d better go home soon, before it gets\ndark. Y-you’ll walk back with me...won’t you?"
