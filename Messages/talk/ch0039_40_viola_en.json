    "ch0039_40_viola/0101_0701_02_10": "There’s bound to be a great photo op waiting for\nus—one the likes of which we’ve never seen!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7101_0701_01_10": "A long time ago, people used to think that\nhaving your photo taken would steal your soul!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7101_0701_02_10": "If that were true, do you think I would’ve become\na Ghost-type user?",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7102_0701_01_10": "I want to get shots of everyone smiling happily as\nthey receive their presents! Fantastic! Just fantastic!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7102_0701_02_10": "C’mon, you too! Stand next to your Pokémon—and\nsay cheese!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7103_0701_01_10": "My older sister gave me my camera.",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7103_0701_02_10": "Small things like that can really change your life!\nJust like Pokémon!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7104_0701_01_10": "Bug Pokémon grow up so quickly, it can be hard\nto catch them on camera!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7104_0701_02_10": "It kind of reminds me of you, getting stronger\nday-by-day!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7105_0701_01_10": "My Vivillon has a pure white pattern, just like\nsnow!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7105_0701_02_10": "She’s quite resilient against the cold, too... Maybe\nshe was born somewhere cold.",
    "ch0039_40_viola/7105_0701_03_10": "Why don’t you try raising a bunch of different\nVivillon, [Name:PlayerNickname ]? It’d be\nfantastic! Just fantastic!",

    "ch0039_40_viola/1701_0702_01_10": "I hope it helps you have the best day ever!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2501_0701_01_10": "Taking photos of people and Pokémon is totally\ndifferent from taking landscape photos!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2501_0701_02_10": "If you asked me which I prefer, well...\nHmm, that’s a tough question!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2501_0701_03_10": "So that’s why...taking photos of people and\nPokémon surrounded by gorgeous scenery would\nbe fantastic! Just fantastic!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2501_0702_01_10": "Should I stand back and take a photo that captures\nthe whole atmosphere? Or zoom in to really\nexpress each subject’s individual sparkle?",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2501_0702_02_10": "Trying to decide which would stand out more\nis part of what makes photography so interesting!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2511_0701_01_10": "If I were to get a present...I’d like to get the time\nto go on a trip with my camera!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2511_0701_02_10": "Have you heard of the Bug-Catching Contest in\nJohto? I really want to enter it sometime!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2511_0701_03_10": "But I might get wrapped up in taking\npictures than actually catching anything...",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2511_0702_01_10": "If you slather honey on a tree and then wait for a\nbit, you’ll find the tree packed with Bug Pokémon!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/2511_0702_02_10": "But to catch them or to photograph them... That is\nthe question.",
    "ch0039_40_viola/3001_0701_01_10": "Good morning! Since I woke up early, I might run\nacross lots of things to photograph!",
    "ch0039_40_viola/3003_0701_01_10": "Now’s the time of day when the folks in my\nviewfinder start getting lively—they’re all smiles!",
