    "ch0133_10_shilver/7101_0701_02_10": "It means fighting alongside your Pokémon—and\nnot being overconfident in your own skills.",
    "ch0133_10_shilver/7101_0701_03_10": "A long time ago, I used to think only weaklings\nput their trust in their Pokémon during battle.",

    "ch0133_10_shilver/7103_0701_02_10": "These outfits’ designs are based on Pokémon...",
    "ch0133_10_shilver/7103_0701_03_10": "Maybe if I battle wearing this, I’ll understand\nPokémon’s feelings better than before.",

    "ch0133_10_shilver/7104_0701_03_10": "Take it in and get stronger—until the day you’re\nstrong enough to surpass him!",

    "ch0133_10_shilver/2501_0701_03_10": "Maybe I could learn something from them...",
    "ch0133_10_shilver/2501_0702_01_10": "I’ve heard that Sneasel live in harsh conditions in\nother regions too.",
    "ch0133_10_shilver/2501_0702_02_10": "If I come across anyone who seems to know more,\nmaybe I’ll ask.",

    "ch0133_10_shilver/2511_0702_02_10": "It’s completely against my philosophy, but teaming\nup with others can lead to greater strength...",
    "ch0133_10_shilver/2511_0702_03_10": "Tch! I’m not good enough yet to get stronger by\nteaming up.",
