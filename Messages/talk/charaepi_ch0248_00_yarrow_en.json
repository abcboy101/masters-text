    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0200_10": "Hey, [Name:PlayerNickname ]! Come take a\nlook at this!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0300_10": "Ever since we arrived on Pasio, Eldegoss’s cotton\nhas been looking more beautiful than ever!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0400_10": "I guess coming here from Galar’s been a good\nchange of environment for him.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0500_10": "Speaking of which, in case you didn’t know...",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0600_10": "Thread made from Eldegoss cotton is a\nGalar specialty!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0700_10": "That’s why Eldegoss is such a familiar Pokémon to\nthe people of Galar.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0800_10": "I’ve been with my Eldegoss a long time now,\nand he’s always helping me out!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_0900_10": "He doesn’t just battle with me at my Gym.\nHe also helps me farm!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_1000_10": "I hope Eldegoss and I can do some farming\ntogether here on Pasio, too.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_1100_10": "The soil on Pasio seems fertile, so I’m sure it’s\nworth cultivating!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_1200_10": "It’s odd, actually. No matter where I go on\nPasio, the soil’s always ideal.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_0301_1300_10": "Maybe because it’s an artificial\nisland?",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_0401_1400_10": "Wait, really? You mean this island wasn’t formed\nnaturally?!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_0302_1500_10": "They brought soil here from all sorts\nof places.",

    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_1800_10": "I couldn’t tell! The land and foliage look\nso natural!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_1900_10": "They must’ve had a soil specialist!",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_2000_10": "I’d love to meet them. But I guess that might be\ntough, huh.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_2100_10": "Just as Eldegoss spreads the nutritious seeds\nattached to its cotton fluff on the wind so that\nplants and other Pokémon can benefit from them...",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_2200_10": "I’ll bet that specialist is traveling all over the\nworld, enriching the land wherever they go.",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_2300_10": "What do you think, Eldegoss?",
    "charaepi_ch0248_00_yarrow/2301_1201_2400_10": "It’s a big, wide world here on Pasio.\nSo from now on, let’s make the most of it!"
