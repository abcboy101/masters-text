    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1101_0200_20": "Even as a training partner, Groudon was\nincredibly powerful.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0300_10": "Thanks for joining us, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0400_10": "I have to admit...",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0500_10": "Groudon sure is powerful!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0600_10": "Even in this form, Groudon has incredible strength.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0700_10": "But when it regains its true form through Primal\nReversion, it can unleash its true power.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_0800_10": "I hear it can cause magma to erupt and even\nexpand the landmass of the world!",

    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1000_10": "Groudon saved people from floods by evaporating\nheavy rainfalls.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1100_10": "In other words, Groudon’s power is that of\nnature itself.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1200_10": "Controlling nature and saving humans is on a\nwhole different scale.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1300_10": "That’s why it’d be disastrous if Groudon’s power\nwere misused.",

    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1600_10": "I’ve gotta stay vigilant about Groudon’s\nnatural energy.",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1700_10": "That’s why, when it comes to Groudon, I need to\nseriously think things through!",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1800_10": "I gotta consider how to treat Groudon, how to\nconnect with it as a partner...",
    "charaepi_ch0019_90_yuki/2301_1201_1900_10": "and what I can do to be a suitable Trainer!",
