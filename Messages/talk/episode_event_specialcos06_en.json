    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_1800_10": "Well, being strong and cool, of course!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_1900_10": "Just like the Masked Royal!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2000_10": "I see...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2100_10": "You’re not wrong, but there’s more to being a\nhero than just being strong!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2200_10": "You also need to inspire hope, courage, and\nenergy in the people watching you!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2300_10": "You’ve gotta get the audience really fired up!\nTHAT’s what it means to be a hero!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2400_10": "Fire up the audience...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2500_10": "Of course! That’s what we’re missing!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2600_10": "We need to think about the audience!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2700_10": "That’s right! When you’re putting on a show,\ngetting the audience emotionally invested is key!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2800_10": "That means riveting plot twists to keep us on the\nedge of our seats! Drawing us in deeper and\ndeeper until—!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_2900_10": "Oh...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3000_10": "You really like heroes, don’tcha?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3100_10": "Y-yeah... Watching lots of hero shows is one of\nmy indoor hobbies...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3200_10": "Oooh! Tell us more about that!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3300_10": "Yeah! What kind of heroes do you like?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3400_10": "All right, then. I’ll keep geeking out about heroes.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4003_1001_3500_10": "But when I’m done, I want to hear about your\nfavorite heroes, too.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1101_0100_20": "Days later...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0200_10": "So, basically, you’ve come to us to see if our\nexperience could help you out?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0300_10": "Yes! Penny said that if we wanted tips on how to\nmake our matches more interesting...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0400_10": "we should talk to Gym Leaders from Galar!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0500_10": "You have superexciting battles in your stadiums,\nright?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0600_10": "Sure do. Penny knows what she’s talking about.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0700_10": "Hehe... Well, my family does hail from Galar.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0800_10": "You’re both popular for your ability to get the\ncrowd going, so...if you have any advice...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_0900_10": "Of course! I can teach you all sorts of things! First\nof all...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1000_10": "Oh yeah, you two are teaming up for your next\nmatch, aren’t you?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1100_10": "In that case, you’ll have to work together as a\ntag team!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1200_10": "That’s right!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1300_10": "For example, when Raihan and I team up, he\nthrows down a sandstorm...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1400_10": "...And I support Gordie’s Pokémon! With our\ndynamic teamwork, we get the whole crowd\ninvolved and up on their feet!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1500_10": "If we pull it off perfectly, the crowd’s eyes are\nglued to us!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1600_10": "So we need a tag-team move, huh?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1700_10": "Always keep in mind what the crowd most wants\nto see!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4004_1001_1800_10": "If you think about the heroes you admire and how\nthey battle...you’ll figure it out, I’m sure!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1101_0100_20": "Next, Barry and Selene trained with Palmer...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0200_10": "Nice! Seems like you’re both getting it!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0300_10": "Hey there, Selene, Barry!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0400_10": "Professor Kukui!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0500_10": "I got curious and came to check in on you both...\nLooking good, you two!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0600_10": "I can’t wait until the day of the match!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0700_10": "Are you coming to watch us, too, Professor?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0800_10": "Hm? O-oh yeah! Of course!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_0900_10": "Sorry I interrupted you, Palmer...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1000_10": "No problem at all! Now, let’s carry on!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1100_10": "There’s more to making a battle exciting than just\ngoing all out and winning!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1200_10": "For example, in the Battle Tower, I adjust the\nstrength of my attacks based on my opponent’s\nwin streak.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1300_10": "By doing that, I draw out the challenger’s strength\nand encourage their growth!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1400_10": "Your battle theater should follow the same idea.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1500_10": "If you can draw out your opponent’s strength, I\nbet you the crowd would go wild!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1600_10": "Yeah! Like pretending you’re in a pinch and\ntrading the advantage back and forth with the\nopponent!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1700_10": "Hey, you know your stuff! One way to do that is,\ninstead of dodging a move...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1800_10": "you take the hit and show the crowd just how\nstrong you and your opponent are!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_1900_10": "I see! Let’s try that as well!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4005_1001_2000_10": "Go on—you can be all that you desire!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0100_10": "So, to recap the advice we got from Professor\nKukui and Palmer...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0200_10": "Instead of a one-sided battle, we need to add\nvariety by getting into pinches from time to time!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0300_10": "But that doesn’t mean we should take it easy\non purpose, either...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0400_10": "We need a way to come back from a pinch\nand win...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0500_10": "That’s the perfect time...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4006_1001_0600_10": "to show off your finishing moves!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0100_10": "Why don’t you pick a finishing move to spice up\nyour match?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0200_10": "A finishing move, huh... In Alola, they have\nZ-moves.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0300_10": "And on Pasio, I guess it’s sync moves?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0400_10": "But everyone here uses sync moves, so those\nwouldn’t have much of an impact, would they?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0500_10": "Not necessarily.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0600_10": "Even simple punches and kicks can get pretty\nflashy, thanks to how special effects have gotten\nbetter over time...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0700_10": "And even a well-known move can be exciting if\nsomeone unexpected uses it!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0800_10": "Something people wouldn’t expect us to do...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_0900_10": "What about Mega Evolution?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1000_10": "Heracross and Scizor have Mega Evolutions,\ndon’t they?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1100_10": "Oh yeah! Mega Evolutions!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1200_10": "Heracross and I made it through a whole\nadventure in Sinnoh together as partners...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1300_10": "but if we could get a new power like Mega\nEvolution, that would be so cool—even for me!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1400_10": "Let’s do this, Heracross!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1500_10": "A longtime partner getting a buff, huh... Nice.\nThat hits you right in the feels.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1600_10": "How did you and Scizor meet, Selene?",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1700_10": "She and I met when I came to Pasio and traded\nPokémon with Elio.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1800_10": "Apparently Elio’s Scyther had a Metal Coat item\nthat she brought with her everywhere.",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_1900_10": "And when Elio traded Scyther while she was\nholding it, she evolved into Scizor!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_2000_10": "Ahh! So it’s a Pokémon that evolves by trading!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_2100_10": "At the time, it really shocked me!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_2200_10": "Maybe by using Mega Evolution, I could feel that\nshock again!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_2300_10": "Let’s give Mega Evolution our best shot, Scizor!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4007_1001_2400_10": "All right! Let’s begin our hardcore training to\nperfect our finishing moves!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0100_10": "Hehe! Our training went really well!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0200_10": "I’m even more excited for the match!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0300_10": "Looks like you’ve come a long way since we last\nsaw you!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0400_10": "Oh, master!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0500_10": "In recognition of your progress, these outfits are\nfor you!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0600_10": "As promised, WE will be your next opponents!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0700_10": "Finally, we can battle you both!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0800_10": "And in cool costumes, too!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_0900_10": "Is this it?! The moment when the first generation\nof heroes passes the torch—costumes, convictions,\nand everything?!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_1000_10": "And when this new generation of heroes emerges\nvictorious, their predecessors can then retire with\nno regrets—",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_1100_10": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who said anything about\nretiring?!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_1200_10": "We’ve been searching for the answer to the\nquestion, “what is a hero?”",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4008_1001_1300_10": "And in our tag-team match, we’ll show you what\nwe found!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1101_0100_20": "The day of the match...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0200_10": "Hello, youngsters! Looking a little better\nthan before!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0300_10": "Let’s see what the next generation of heroes\ncan do!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0400_10": "Oh, it’s ON!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0500_10": "We’ll hit you with our full strength, turned up to Z!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0600_10": "There’s the determination! Come at us head-on,\nfair and square!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0700_10": "We’re gonna take all your attacks—and STILL win!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0800_10": "Nice moves!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_0900_10": "Now it’s my turn!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1000_10": "Bring it on, master! We’ll take your attack too!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1100_10": "Whoa! Th-that was ridiculously powerful...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1200_10": "Scizor! Let’s help them out!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1300_10": "Oh no you don’t!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1400_10": "Ahh...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1500_10": "Ready up, Crasher Wake!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1600_10": "Let’s show them our teamwork!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1700_10": "Yeah! Let’s hit them with a big one!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1800_10": "Crash! Crash! Crasher...",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_1900_10": "Royal...battle!",
    "episode_event_specialcos06/4009_1001_2000_10": "Whoa, geez!",
