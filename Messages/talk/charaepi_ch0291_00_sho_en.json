    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_0300_10": "You see, I’ve been training with Samurott here to\ndeepen our bond.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_0400_10": "But...I can’t seem to keep up with his energy.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_0500_10": "It’s not easy for people and Pokémon to truly be in\nsync with one another, huh?",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0301_0600_10": "Is Samurott your partner Pokémon?",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0401_0700_10": "That’s right!",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0401_0800_10": "There are some other Pokémon that have been\nwith me since I came to Hisui...",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0302_0900_10": "Who’s this Pikachu?",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0402_1000_10": "Pikachu’s been my dependable companion ever\nsince we were in Hisui.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0402_1100_10": "There are some other Pokémon that came here\nwith me...",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_1200_10": "But Samurott is the only one that’s become my\nsync partner on Pasio so far.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_1300_10": "My other Pokémon seem wary of the environment\non this island and these strange Poké Balls.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_1400_10": "But I met Samurott right after we got to Pasio...",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_1500_10": "Maybe that’s why he didn’t seem to hesitate with\nthese future Poké Balls?",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_1600_10": "Anyway, that’s why Samurott is my only sync\npartner for now.",

    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2000_10": "In order to catch up to him, I felt a strong need to\nface my Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2100_10": "and connect with them in the same way that\neveryone on Pasio does with theirs.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2200_10": "I want to reach your and Rei’s level!",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2300_10": "Samurott taught me how harsh wild Pokémon\ncan be...",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2400_10": "and the potential for people and Pokémon to live\nside by side.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_2500_10": "I want to build my relationship with Samurott from\nscratch without fearing his power—and for us to\nbe able to understand one another.",

    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0302_2900_10": "Partners you can depend on!",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_0402_3000_10": "You really get what I’m trying to say!",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_3100_10": "I’ve been asking myself what Pokémon mean\nto me.",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_3200_10": "I’m determined to really work with Samurott to\nfind the answer!",
    "charaepi_ch0291_00_sho/2301_1201_3300_10": "When we become a sync pair that’s just as\nbrilliant as you and Rei are with your\npartner Pokémon...",
