    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7101_0701_01_10": "I studied all sorts of subjects at my school in \nPaldea—biology, history, math...",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7101_0701_02_10": "The classes were hard, so every now and then I\nhad a little trouble keeping up, but I made up for\nit with some serious studying!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7101_0701_03_10": "All the teachers were great, too!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7102_0701_01_10": "Whenever I’m told a place is off-limits, I get\nreeeally curious about it. Don’t you?",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7102_0701_02_10": "And when I’m told I shouldn’t challenge certain\ndangerous Pokémon out there, it makes me wanna\nmeet them!",

    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7104_0701_02_10": "You can swap out their covers or use the\nRoto-Stick to take cool photos—stuff like that!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7104_0701_03_10": "But sometimes that actually kinda slows down\nour travels...",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7105_0701_01_10": "Do you like studying, [Name:PlayerNickname ]?\nDo you have a favorite subject or anything?",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7105_0701_02_10": "Heh heh... I thought maybe you could teach me\nwhatever you’re good at, if it’s something I’m not.",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/7105_0701_03_10": "Oh, and while we’re at it, why don’t we get some\nother people together and form a study group?",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/1701_0701_01_10": "Here’s a present from me to you! I’m sure it’ll be\nuseful!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/1701_0702_01_10": "Thinking about how best to use your items is an\nimportant kind of studying!",

    "ch0287_00_svgirl/2501_0702_02_10": "I don’t know what sort of shine will catch\nmy eye...",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/2501_0702_03_10": "but when it happens, I’m sure you’ll be right\nthere with me!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/2511_0701_01_10": "Did you know Nemona has a huuuge house?",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/2511_0701_02_10": "Her family’s even got in-house staff. I was really\nsurprised the first time I went there!",

    "ch0287_00_svgirl/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! Any plans for today? Maybe some\nstudying, battling, or cooking?",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/3003_0701_01_10": "If you’re tired from battling and studying too much,\nclear your mind with a picnic!",
    "ch0287_00_svgirl/3005_0701_01_10": "The shooting stars in the night sky remind me of\nmy shining adventures in Paldea!"
