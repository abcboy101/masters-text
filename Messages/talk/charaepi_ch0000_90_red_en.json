    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1101_0200_20": "Instead of the solitary scene [EN:Gen Ref=\"255\" M=\"he’d\" F=\"she’d\" ] expected, [EN:Gen Ref=\"255\" M=\"he\" F=\"she\" ]\ncame across three people talking happily.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_0300_10": "I can see why you and Articuno were chosen to\nbe Neo Champions of Pasio!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_0400_10": "Those Ice-type moves were impressive even\nto me!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_0500_10": "Your average Trainer would be so entranced by\nthe beauty of the ice, they’d be frozen solid before\nthey snapped out of it!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_0600_10": "Yeah, it’s not just strong. The way it moves as it\nfights—almost like it’s dancing—is sure to charm\nanyone who sees it.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0301_0700_10": "Articuno!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0401_0800_10": "Wow, I’m surprised to see you all the way out\nhere, [Name:PlayerNickname ]!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0302_0900_10": "What a beautiful Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0402_1000_10": "Oh, hey, it’s [Name:PlayerNickname ]!\nI’m surprised to see you all the way out here!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1100_10": "... ... ...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1200_10": "But at any rate, Red... Where did you catch\nArticuno, anyway?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1300_10": "I’m pretty sure I heard that they met at the\nSeafoam Islands.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1400_10": "Although Red had seen Articuno before actually\ncoming face-to-face with it, and had been\nrunning around searching for it for ages.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1500_10": "I think you saw it through some binoculars at the\ngate by Fuchsia City, right?",

    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1700_10": "Well, the caverns underneath the Seafoam Islands\nare certainly very cold.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1800_10": "A lot of very powerful Ice-type Pokémon make\ntheir homes there.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_1900_10": "Not many Trainers venture there either, so I\nsuppose it was a pretty comfortable place\nfor Articuno.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2000_10": "But to think Articuno was so close to me... I sure\nmissed out!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2100_10": "Well, Articuno still took a long time to warm up to\nRed, even after it was caught. It is a Legendary\nPokémon, after all.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0301_2200_10": "Really?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0401_2300_10": "... ... ...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0302_2400_10": "That must have been tough.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_0402_2500_10": "... ... ...!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2600_10": "Clearly it takes a legendary Trainer to be\nrecognized by a legendary bird Pokémon...",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2700_10": "After all, he’s a “living legend”! Haha!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2800_10": "And I’m sure he’ll keep showing us battles that live\nup to that reputation!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_2900_10": "Of course...Red’s not the only Trainer who’s been\nrecognized by a legendary bird Pokémon,\nyou know.",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_3000_10": "... ... ...!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_3100_10": "You two really are ALWAYS competing with each\nother, aren’t you?",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_3200_10": "Of course!",
    "charaepi_ch0000_90_red/2301_1201_3300_10": "If we weren’t, none of this would feel worth as\nmuch to Red or Articuno, would it?",
