    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0200_10": "I know it was a last-minute invitation,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ], but I really\nappreciate your showing up!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0300_10": "Thanks to you, I think I’ve got the hang of battling\nin this outfit.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0400_10": "This is the first time I’ve witnessed a sync stone\nultimate’s power up close... It certainly does hold\nincredible strength!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0500_10": "And of course, you and Metagross are as skilled\nas ever, Steven!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0600_10": "But...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0700_10": "Hm? Did you notice something?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0800_10": "Well, it seemed like you weren’t giving many\norders to Metagross... That stood out as odd\nto me.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_0900_10": "Aha! Excellent observation!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1000_10": "The reason for that lies in Metagross’s brains.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1100_10": "What do you mean?",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1200_10": "Metagross’s brains are said to be more intelligent\nthan a supercomputer.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1300_10": "That’s why I put a good deal of trust in\nMetagross’s own decisions.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1400_10": "But I don’t just leave everything to it.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_1500_10": "It’s the instructions I give at critical moments that\nlead us to victory.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_0301_1600_10": "So you’re the one in the lead.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_0401_1700_10": "Yes, that’s how things should be with a Trainer\nand a Pokémon.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_0401_1800_10": "They should trust and respect each other...just like\nme and Metagross!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_0302_1900_10": "You’re both really smart!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_0402_2000_10": "I’m happy to hear the compliment, both for me and\nMetagross!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2100_10": "But that strategy only works because you trust\neach other so much!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2200_10": "Metagross may be used to making its own\ndecisions, but it does follow your lead when it\nreally counts!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2300_10": "Even if the result is the same—the Pokémon\ndeciding what to do on its own—",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2400_10": "this is totally different from a Pokémon that simply\nrefuses to listen to an underqualified Trainer!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2500_10": "I think the reason we’re able to battle effectively\ntogether like this...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2600_10": "is because we’ve known each other for so long,\never since it was a Beldum!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2700_10": "When I first encountered Beldum...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2800_10": "it felt like destiny—an instant sensation telling me,\n“This Pokémon is the one!”",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_2900_10": "And now that I’ve awakened to the power of the\narc suit, I can say with confidence that my feeling\nwas correct!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3000_10": "My partner Metagross is so understanding and\ndependable...or to put it simply...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3100_10": "my Metagross is truly strong and cool!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3200_10": "And to prove that we’re the strongest sync pair\nthere is right now...",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3300_10": "I plan to keep polishing our skills until they gleam\neven brighter!",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3400_10": "I’m sure that sync pairs have an absolutely infinite\ncapacity to shine.",
    "charaepi_ch0090_90_daigo/2301_1201_3500_10": "And I’m looking forward to seeing just how far\nyou’re able to take your own sparkle in the future!"
