    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1001_0200_10": "So if you want to battle, you need three sync pairs\nto form a team!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1001_0300_10": "The trick is to understand who’s good at what—\nand to put together a balanced team!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1001_0400_10": "And! So! This is how it’s gonna go down!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1001_0500_10": "First things firstly! For your big Pasio Pokémon\nbattle debut, we’re gonna have you team up\nwith US!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1101_0600_20": "If you’re new to battling, focus on putting together\nteams that have a strike, tech, and support\nsync pair!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4001_1101_0700_20": "In this event, you can team up with one sync pair\nper role and test them out in battle!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4002_1001_0100_10": "I’m first, so lemme explain my role! I’m a strike\nsync pair!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4002_1001_0200_10": "Strike sync pairs are gonna be the hard-hitting\ncore of your offensive game!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4002_1001_0300_10": "We fly high like a Wattrel and hit ’em hard with\nour attacks!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4002_1001_0400_10": "Buuuut...we’re also fragile when it comes to\ndefense... Oh noes...",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4002_1001_0500_10": "That’s why you gotta get ANOTHER sync pair to\ntake those attacks for ya! Ya feel me?",

    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0100_10": "Next is me. I’ll be talking about support\nsync pairs.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0200_10": "We’re good at strengthening allies and\nrestoring HP, among other things.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0300_10": "We know how to take a hit, so we’re well-suited\nto being your opponents’ first target!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0400_10": "Let me take the damage from their attacks!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0500_10": "We’re super solid—and shine bright as the center\nof attention.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4003_1001_0600_10": "So in a way, I suppose our role is similar to a\ngemstone’s!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4004_1001_0100_10": "Last but not least, let me tell you about tech\nsync pairs.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4004_1001_0200_10": "We can do all sorts of things, like give opponents\nstatus conditions or lower their stats!",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4004_1001_0300_10": "So I guess we’ve a little somethin’ to cover\nwhatever the strike and support sync pairs can’t.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4004_1001_0400_10": "The tougher your opponents, the more you’ll\nprobably rely on pairs like us.",
    "episode_event_card_collab/4004_1001_0500_10": "No matter how tough they are, though, don’t\ngive up! I’m cheerin’ for ya!"
