    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1000_10": "I mean...UBs can be scary, sure.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1100_10": "But can’t we say that about other Pokémon, too?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1200_10": "Think of any Legendary Pokémon—like the tapu,\nfor example!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1300_10": "They’re REALLY powerful, but we can still be\nfriends with them!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1400_10": "Considering that, you’d think there’d be more\nacceptance of UBs...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1500_10": "Maybe it’s because Ultra Beasts look so strange\nand different.",

    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4002_1001_1700_10": "If only we could get people to understand how\nmuch fun it is know the unknown...",

    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0100_10": "So these are...Ultra Beasts?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0200_10": "What unique Pokémon! I wonder what kind of lives\nthey lead!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0300_10": "Um... So you’re not scared of them?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0400_10": "Well... I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0500_10": "But these Pokémon being Ultra Beasts doesn’t make\nthem any scarier than usual, I think.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_0600_10": "If you don’t know what makes a Pokémon\ndangerous, then you need to survey it more!",

    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1200_10": "So this is what you were talking about before,\nElio?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1300_10": "Yep!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1400_10": "The last time I hung out with Rei, we talked a lot.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1500_10": "He mentioned that there were a lot of things\nabout Pokémon that were still unknown back\nin the times of Hisui. ",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1600_10": "In other words, the Pokémon that we consider\nordinary now were like UBs to the people of\nHisui—dangerous, mysterious creatures.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1700_10": "People are used to Pokémon in this era, but I\nguess in the end, that core fear is still the same.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1800_10": "At first, I was scared of Pokémon that could\ncreate electricity or fire, especially since I didn’t\nunderstand them.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_1900_10": "It took a while to build a relationship with them\nuntil they became partners I could trust.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2000_10": "Um... As a member of the Survey Corps, I wanted\nto ask...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2100_10": "These UBs are from a different world, right? Can\nyou catch them with Poké Balls?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2200_10": "Ooooh, good question, Rei!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2300_10": "You can, but it’s pretty difficult.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2400_10": "So difficult, in fact, that the Aether Foundation\nactually developed a special type of Poké Ball\ncalled a Beast Ball.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2500_10": "Beast Balls make it easier to catch UBs, but\nthey don’t work well on other Pokémon.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2600_10": "Interesting...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2700_10": "But they can only be produced in small amounts\nand can’t be found in regular stores, so not too\nmany people know about them.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2800_10": "Maybe that’s one of the reasons why people find\nit hard to get closer to UBs?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_2900_10": "Even in Hisui, Poké Balls weren’t widespread, so\nPokémon wielders were rare.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3000_10": "Maybe once Beast Balls are widely available,\nmore Trainers could partner up with UBs. That\ncould change some minds!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3100_10": "But we can’t just sit and wait for that to happen!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3200_10": "I’m sure we can do what we did in Hisui when\nwe would share the info we gathered from our\nsurveys...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3300_10": "We can survey UBs, too, and introduce them to\neven more people!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3400_10": "The way people and Pokémon coexist has\nevolved over time.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3500_10": "In Hisui, people started having Pokémon help with\ntasks and work, which let humans become more\nfamiliar with them.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3600_10": "I think this is a chance for us to start changing the\nway we coexist with UBs, too!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3700_10": "Let’s keep convincing more people to join us!\nI’ll help you!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3800_10": "After all, if these UBs are Pokémon from another\nworld... I can relate to that on a personal level.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_3900_10": "I’ll help you, too! I have some experience with\novercoming the fear of Pokémon!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_4000_10": "Thanks, Akari! You too, Rei!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_4100_10": "I’m so glad I asked you two for advice!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4003_1001_4200_10": "Now that we have some reliable friends helping\nus out, let’s head back into town!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0100_10": "Hey, everyone! Gather round!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0200_10": "This is my partner Pokémon, Nihilego!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0300_10": "Sometimes, its movements and gestures make it\nlook like a little girl!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0400_10": "I can kinda see that!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0500_10": "So you know what I did? I decided to find some\ncommon ground and look for things it might like!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0600_10": "We went to a lot of different shops and stopped\nat some cafés...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0700_10": "And guess what I learned! This Nihilego really\nloves cute clothes and sweets!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0800_10": "Oooh, I love cute clothes and sweets too!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_0900_10": "I don’t think it understands human speech, but\nit really seems to be enjoying itself!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1000_10": "That’s friend material right there, don’t you think?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1100_10": "Now, as for Stakataka...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1200_10": "It can be intimidating when it’s aggressive, but\nit’s usually super calm.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1300_10": "When it stands still like that, it really does look\njust like a wall...",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1400_10": "Yeah, it seems to prefer just standing around\ninstead of being really active.",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1500_10": "Oh, interesting!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1600_10": "So it’s quiet, then...just like my Nosepass!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1700_10": "Do you have any other interesting stories about\nUBs?",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1800_10": "Oh, a ton!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_1900_10": "Wanna meet the others, too?",

    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4004_1001_2100_10": "Then, let’s have the Aether Foundation bring\nthem out!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4005_1001_0100_10": "It went great this time!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4005_1001_0200_10": "Good job, Stakataka and Nihilego!",

    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4005_1001_0800_10": "We can team up with the Masked Royal...with\nBrycen-Man and Bellelba as our opponents!",
    "episode_event_ch0123_ch0122/4005_1001_0900_10": "If Nihilego can play the hero, I’m sure it’ll become\nmore approachable!",
