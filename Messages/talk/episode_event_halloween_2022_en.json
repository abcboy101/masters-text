    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4004_1001_1500_10": "That’s great! We might be able to find\nthe monster!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4004_1001_1600_10": "In the forest...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4004_1001_1700_10": "Are you thinking of going there to investigate?",

    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4004_1001_1900_10": "Um... Well, I’m a Gym Leader and have other\nthings to do, so...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4004_1001_2000_10": "I’ll leave the monster to you!",

    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_0100_10": "Is it a...Pokémon?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_0200_10": "I’m not sure. It doesn’t look like a\nghost Pokémon...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_0300_10": "Maybe it’s an alien.",

    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1000_10": "So were you the one telling people in the city not\nto talk about it?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1100_10": "Yes. I wanted to take care of it quietly.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1200_10": "Oh... So you’re taking it away?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1300_10": "Please! Let us play with Poipole a bit more.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1400_10": "This Pokémon is dangerous. Even if it doesn’t mean\nyou any harm, we can’t let it roam around freely.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1500_10": "But I can tell how it’s feeling! I bet it was just\nafraid because it came to a place it doesn’t\nknow well!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1600_10": "I was the same when I moved to the large cities\nof Unova from the Village of the Dragons!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1700_10": "I was really nervous since there were so many tall\nbuildings—and a lot of people.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1800_10": "But now I love Unova!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_1900_10": "So I want Poipole to fall in love with Pasio before\ngoing home!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2000_10": "I-if you don’t mind, I’d like that, too.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2100_10": "I think it’s normal for creatures from different\nworlds to find each other scary, but...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2200_10": "I think it’s sad to push someone away just because\nof that.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2300_10": "I know... However, I don’t think we’ll be able to\nreach that level of understanding...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2400_10": "Well...perhaps I shouldn’t dismiss the idea\nentirely before trying.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2500_10": "Why don’t we, then? I’ll allow you to watch over\nPoipole for a while.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2600_10": "Help it make some nice memories, OK?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4006_1001_2700_10": "Will do! Thanks a bunch, Lusamine!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_0100_10": "OK! Let’s go, Poipole.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_0200_10": "So, it was a Pokémon after all.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_0300_10": "I guess I’ve done my part... I should probably\ngo home.",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_0400_10": "Oh! Um...",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_3800_10": "Since you’re already here... D-do you want to join\nour team?",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_0500_10": "I’m not sure... I don’t really like it when things are\ntoo lively...",

    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_1400_10": "Yay! It’s gotten pretty lively!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_1500_10": "You won’t be getting our candy that easily!",
    "episode_event_halloween_2022/4007_1001_1600_10": "Now, Poipole! Let’s give it all we’ve got and win\nthis battle!",
