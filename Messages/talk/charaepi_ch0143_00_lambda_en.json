    "charaepi_ch0143_00_lambda/2301_1201_0300_10": "No... That was too wild. I need to make it sound\na bit more intelligent.",

    "charaepi_ch0143_00_lambda/2301_1201_1000_10": "Well, you saw everything, so I may as\nwell explain.",
    "charaepi_ch0143_00_lambda/2301_1201_1100_10": "Next to the real Giovanni, it’s easy to spot the\nflaws in my impersonation. So, I was working on\nmy technique.",
