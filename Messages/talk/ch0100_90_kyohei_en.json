    "ch0100_90_kyohei/0101_0701_02_10": "Come on, let’s go have some more Pokémon\nbattles today!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7101_0701_01_10": "My Haxorus is a little different from the ones you\nusually see—he’s special!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7101_0701_02_10": "He’s got a really cool, stylish look to him. He’s just\nthe best!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7102_0701_01_10": "Isn’t this outfit awesome?! I feel like the main\ncharacter in a Pokéstar Studios movie!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7102_0701_02_10": "Though, if I were in a Pokéstar Studios movie,\nwhat do you suppose the story would be?",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7103_0701_01_10": "I’ve gotten stronger since coming to Pasio...",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7103_0701_02_10": "But Rosa’s improved just as much! I guess I really\nshouldn’t be surprised!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7103_0701_03_10": "As a Neo Champion, I’m gonna work as hard as I\ncan to keep up with Rosa, you, and everyone else!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7104_0701_01_10": "Dragon tamers are all so amazing—I can’t help\nbut admire them!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7104_0701_02_10": "I mean, just catching and raising dragon Pokémon\nis really, REALLY difficult!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7104_0701_03_10": "And those outfits they wear... Not everyone can\npull off that look, you know!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7105_0701_01_10": "Do you have a special Pokémon,\n[Name:PlayerNickname ]?",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7105_0701_02_10": "It could be a rare Pokémon, or one you share fond\nmemories with, or one you’re especially close to...\nI think all Pokémon are special in some way.",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7105_0701_03_10": "Anyway, if you’ve got a special Pokémon, let’s\nhave it and my Haxorus battle each other!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/7105_0701_04_10": "We’ll see which kind of “special” is the strongest!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/1701_0701_01_10": "Oh, there you are! There’s something I wanted to\ngive you!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/1701_0701_02_10": "This is just a thank-you for always hanging out\nwith me!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/1701_0702_01_10": "Heh heh... Please keep hanging out with me from\nnow on, as well!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2501_0701_01_10": "Hey! Did you know there are special places that\naren’t open to just any old Trainer?",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2501_0701_02_10": "Only a handful of Trainers are allowed inside!\nSounds exciting, don’t you think?",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2501_0702_01_10": "I bet there are lots of places around the world that\nregular people can’t get into...",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2501_0702_02_10": "If I keep getting stronger and learn even more\nabout Pokémon, do you think I’ll be allowed in?",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2501_0702_03_10": "When that day comes, let’s go on an adventure\ntogether!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2511_0701_01_10": "As strong as we are now, I bet the two of us\ncould get a whole lot of wins at the Battle\nSubway in Unova.",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2511_0701_02_10": "Pokémon-fan synergy can create a combination\nthat’s better than perfect! Together, we could even\ntake on the Subway Bosses!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2511_0702_01_10": "I’ve heard that there are places like the Battle\nSubway in other regions, too, where you can go\nto have Pokémon battles!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2511_0702_02_10": "I bet there are lots of really strong Trainers there!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/2511_0702_03_10": "Maybe we should have a competition to see which\none of us can win at the most different facilities!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/3001_0701_01_10": "Morning! I wonder what’s waiting for us today!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/3003_0701_01_10": "There’s so many strong people in the world!\nI gotta make sure to train properly!",
    "ch0100_90_kyohei/3005_0701_01_10": "You’re up late! If there’s anything I can help you\nwith, just ask!"
